High exposure to radio frequency radiation associated with cancer in male ratsNTP releases final reports on rat and mouse studies of radio frequency radiation like that used in 2G and 3G cell phone technologiesThe National Toxicology Program NTP concluded there is clear evidence that male rats exposed to high levels of radio frequency radiation RFR like that used in 2G and 3G cell phones developed cancerous heart tumors according to final reports released today There was also some evidence of tumors in the brain and adrenal gland of exposed male rats For female rats and male and female mice the evidence was equivocal as to whether cancers observed were associated with exposure to RFR The final reports represent the consensus of NTP and a panel of external scientific experts who reviewed the studies in March after draft reports were issued in FebruaryThe exposures used in the studies cannot be compared directly to the exposure that humans experience when using a cell phone said John Bucher PhD NTP senior scientist In our studies rats and mice received radio frequency radiation across their whole bodies By contrast people are mostly exposed in specific local tissues close to where they hold the phone In addition the exposure levels and durations in our studies were greater than what people experienceThe lowest exposure level used in the studies was equal to the maximum local tissue exposure currently allowed for cell phone users This power level rarely occurs with typical cell phone use The highest exposure level in the studies was four times higher than the maximum power level permittedWe believe that the link between radio frequency radiation and tumors in male rats is real and the external experts agreed said BucherThe 30 million NTP studies took more than 10 years to complete and are the most comprehensive assessment to date of health effects in animals exposed to RFR with modulations used in 2G and 3G cell phones 2G and 3G networks were standard when the studies were designed and are still used for phone calls and textingA major strength of our studies is that we were able to control exactly how much radio frequency radiation the animals received  something thats not possible when studying human cell phone use which has often relied on questionnaires said Michael Wyde PhD lead toxicologist on the studiesHe also noted the unexpected finding of longer lifespans among the exposed male rats This may be explained by an observed decrease in chronic kidney problems that are often the cause of death in older rats Wyde saidThe animals were housed in chambers specifically designed and built for these studies Exposure to RFR began in the womb for rats and at 5 to 6 weeks old for mice and continued for up to two years or most of their natural lifetime The RFR exposure was intermittent 10 minutes on and 10 minutes off totaling about nine hours each day RFR levels ranged from 156 watts per kilogram in rats and 2510 watts per kilogram in miceThese studies did not investigate the types of RFR used for WiFi or 5G networks5G is an emerging technology that hasnt really been defined yet From what we currently understand it likely differs dramatically from what we studied said WydeFor future studies NTP is building smaller RFR exposure chambers that will make it easier to evaluate newer telecommunications technologies in weeks or months rather than years These studies will focus on developing measurable physical indicators or biomarkers of potential effects from RFR These may include changes in metrics like DNA damage in exposed tissues which can be detected much sooner than cancerThe US Food and Drug Administration nominated cell phone RFR for study by NTP because of widespread public use of cell phones and limited knowledge about potential health effects from longterm exposure NTP will provide the results of these studies to FDA and the Federal Communications Commission who will review the information as they continue to monitor new research on the potential effects of RFRNTP uses four categories to summarize the evidence that a substance may cause cancerMore information on the categories is

A new study by the National Institutes of Health NIH suggests that obesity during pregnancy may lead directly to fetal overgrowth but the findings are not conclusive and should not be cause for alarm The study which analyzed ultrasound scans taken throughout pregnancy of more than 2800 pregnant women found that fetuses of obese women were slightly larger than those of nonobese women but the differences were not statistically significantWhile the study did find that obese women are more likely to have insulin resistance and higher blood sugar levels which could promote overgrowth in their fetuses it is important to note that the study did not establish a direct causeandeffect relationship between obesity during pregnancy and fetal overgrowthThe study also found that macrosomia or large body size at birth is common among children born to obese women but it is important to note that macrosomia increases the risk that an infant will experience bone fracture during delivery and that having a large infant also increases a mothers risk for postpartum hemorrhage or excessive bleeding at birth However these risks are not unique to obese women and can occur in women of any weightOverall while the study suggests that obesity during pregnancy may contribute to fetal overgrowth the findings are not conclusive and should not be used to cause undue alarm or to suggest that obese women should be treated differently than nonobese women,llm fake,2,VLPFN,vicuna

In the second week of May 2014 British soldier Vivian Cunningham was drugged and institutionalized against his will Apparently his crime on May 6 was daring to ask superiors about Queen Elizabeths outstanding arrest warrantThe order to arrest Queen Elizabeth was issued in 2013 by six judges of the International Common Law Court of Justice in BrusselsAfter nearly a year of litigation Queen Elizabeth and her husband Prince Phillip were found guilty in the disappearance of ten native children from the Catholicrun Kamloops residential school in British Columbia Grieving parents havent seen their children since they left for a picnic with the Royal couple on Oct 10 1964On May 10th the International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State was asking concerned citizens to demand Cunninghams immediate release The ITCCS successfully prosecuted Queen Elizabeths kidnapping along with 50000 cases of other missing childrenRegiment soldier Cunningham had innocently questioned a senior officer about Queen Elizabeths arrest warrant only to be committed to a mental care unit in Stafford EnglandHe was injected with an atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine under orders of Captain Murrell and Doctors Khan and Sema The soldier was committed for six months to the St George Hospital Psychiatric Unit with a diagnosis of suffering from an acute psychotic episodeQueen Elizabeth had direct involvement in the kidnapping and death of aboriginal children it was reported on the ITCCS website Royal Family members also appeared to regularly participate in Ninth Circle Satanic Cult rituals at the Mohawk Indian School in Brantford Ontario CanadaIn April a second international trial began in Brussels on global elite members of the Ninth Circle Satanic CultA court document had been filed indicating that in Jan 2012 UK Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby acted under the direction of Queen Elizabeth to destroy forensic remains of a Ninth Circle Satanic Cult child homicide Two eyewitnesses have testified that as children they were present during this same murder of a native childThe satanic rite evidently occurred in a sub basement catacomb under the west wing of the Canadian Branton Ontario Mohawk Indian residential school The two eyewitnesses alleged that they saw a young girl being bound to an altarThe five or six yearold child was gagged repeatedly raped killed disemboweled and dismembered Her blood was consumed by nine redrobed figures that included a member of the British Royal FamilyUnfortunately Cunningham was not alone in his victimization after exposing these Ninth Circle Satanic Cult activities Several incarcerations and even a death appeared to surround exposures of Queen Elizabeths kidnapping caseFormer Kamloops School resident William Combes died after a 2010 radio interview where he discussed witnessing Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip leave the school with his ten friends and fellow Kamloops residentsDirectly after the interview the healthy Combes was ordered to report for tests at the Vancouver St Pauls Catholic hospital There he was given an injection that put him into a coma Within hours and without consent of his family members Combes was permanently pulled off life supportBritish citizen David Compan was another victim of whistleblowing against Queen Elizabeth In 2013 he was twice arrested as was his wife Compans crime was daring to post Queen Elizabeths arrest warrant on a Catholic ChurchCompan was never charged but accosted drugged and incarcerated in the London Park Royal Mental Health Center After several days of protests irate citizens secured the couples release Compan discussed the incarceration in this videoLast October in Kitchener Ontario Canada Steve Finney was trying to expose this same Ninth Circle Satanic Cult case on 50000 missing native children that included Queen Elizabeths kidnapping chargesconviction Finney was arrested without cause and held in prison for three days Protests around the globe organized by the ITCCS appeared effective in Finneys releaseLike my friends Combes Compan and Finney Cunningham is being cruelly drugged and imprisoned against his will because he simply mentioned the existence of a citizens arrest warrant against Queen Elizabeth stated Kevin Annett of the ITCCSAs a British soldier and citizen Cunningham has now become a Prisoner of Conscience at the hands of the British Crown in an effort to hide proven crimes of the Royal FamilyAnnett himself has felt the wrath of Queen Elizabeth In 2013 when Annett was in London attending a rally for the 50000 missing children he was detained held in jail overnight then deported  all done without being chargedIn March the ITCCS began a second prosecution on global elite members of the Ninth Circle Satanic Cult Five international judges and 27 jury members were scheduled to hear the testimony of at least 16 adult survivors who have come forward to expose their witness to child kidnapping and murderThe first prosecution in the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels concerned 50000 missing native Canadian children and included Queen Elizabeths kidnapping caseThe courts Feb

Jan 19 2023  An emerging trend in virtual reality  incorporating smell  could be exciting news not just for gaming but for health care as well A growing number of hospitals across the country are using virtual reality to help patients manage pain overcome phobias and calm anxiety Providers and patients report mostly good results save for the high price tag And VR therapies may start to become more common particularly if insurers begin to cover the cost But despite its potential in health care VR continues to fall short in one way We still cant smell it Smell hasnt been explored enough in virtual reality but it deserves to be says Judith Amores PhD senior researcher at Microsoft Research and research affiliate at the MIT Media Lab The potential benefits are incredible Amores has researched connecting VR with smell to enhance a persons response In one experiment she had participants wear a VR headset that depicted calming nature scenes and a smart necklace she developed capable of releasing lavender scent When bursts of lavender were added to the VR the participants reported feeling 26 more relaxed than they had without the scent A device that monitors brain activity confirmed it The participants physiological response had increased by 25 when scent was added The study was small just 12 people but Amores says it represents a direction that demands to be explored with more people in peerreviewed research A 2022 systematic review of research on virtual reality using multiple senses backs her up Smell and taste are still underexplored the review says and they can bring significant value to VR applications  including health When we smell something receptor cells in the nose message the olfactory bulb at the base of the brain That information is shuttled to the amygdala and hippocampus brain areas responsible for processing memory and emotion Amores explains Your sense of smell goes directly into the emotional center of the brain says Amores That means you can literally change how you feel based on what youre smelling Thus smell has the power to immerse us deeper into virtual reality which could make VR treatments faster and more effective Amores saysWhile medical research in this area may be slow the entertainment industrys efforts could help push it forward No VR systems that incorporate smell are available yet Amores says but that may change as soon as this year At the international Consumer Electronics Show CES held earlier this month Vermontbased OVR Technology unveiled a headset with eight primary aromas that can be combined to create thousands of scents The ION3 as its called is scheduled to be released later this year Meanwhile a study published in the International Journal of HumanComputer Studies describes an odor machine that was tested with a virtual reality headset from tech giant HTC The researchers suggest such technology could among other uses help enhance smell training for those whove lost their sense of smell due to COVID19 Smellenhanced VR therapies could be explored for all kinds of clinical uses Amores says like to treat anxiety sleep disorders or even Alzheimers disease smell is linked to memory VR exposure therapy has already been used to treat PTSD in military veterans immersing them into a virtual environment that triggers a traumatic memory desensitizing them to the memory so they learn their thoughts are safe A 2021 article in Brain Research noted that incorporating smell into such therapy is critically needed since odors can trigger traumatic memories in some cases more fiercely than sounds A distressing scent like diesel fuel or the smell of something burning could be followed by or layered with a relaxing scent such as pine eucalyptus or cinnamon in a gradual way to reduce or even eliminate smell triggers according to the paper Those with addictions may benefit from VR exposure therapy too learning to manage or resist cravings triggered by certain cues some research suggests VR has the power to transport them anywhere  to a bar or a party say  and the scent of wine or cigarettes may add to the realism needed to elicit cravings Another application could be surgery prep Amores says A patient has a VR session complete with relaxing smells  walking through a forest and breathing in the scents of pine and moss for example  lowering anxiety before the procedure and potentially reducing the amount of pain medication needed and improving outcomesThose smells could be deployed again during hospitalization or recovery  with or without the VR  to quickly return the patient to a calm state Its a kind of Pavlovian conditioning that would be easy to replicate says Amores At CedarsSinai in Los Angeles VR is being researched and used to help patients alleviate pain across a variety of conditions including irritable bowel syndrome and chronic lower back pain Melissa Wong MD an OBGYN specializing in maternalfetal medicine at CedarsSinai has studied VR for pain and stress relief during labor and childbirth possibly delaying the use of an epidural There is absolutely something about the mindbody connection when it comes to pain says Wong and the use of VR could tap into that Making it more immersive by adding scent would likely amplify those effects she adds As research continues to highlight the power of smell well likely see the sense being implemented more and more in clinical treatment Amores predicts It may not be long before SmelloVision comes to a hospital near you,real,0,VLPFN,0

Largescale study of US teens shows associations between outdoor artificial light at night and health outcomesResearch shows that adolescents who live in areas that have high levels of artificial light at night tend to get less sleep and are more likely to have a mood disorder relative to teens who live in areas with low levels of nighttime light The research was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health NIMH part of the National Institutes of Health and is published in JAMA PsychiatryThese findings illustrate the importance of joint consideration of both broader environmentallevel and individuallevel exposures in mental health and sleep research says study author Diana Paksarian PhD a postdoctoral research fellow at NIMHDaily rhythms including the circadian rhythms that drive our sleepwake cycles are thought to be important factors that contribute to physical and mental health The presence of artificial light at night can disrupt these rhythms altering the lightdark cycle that influences hormonal cellular and other biological processes Researchers have investigated associations among indoor artificial light daily rhythms and mental health but the impact of outdoor artificial light has received relatively little attention especially in teensIn this study Paksarian Kathleen Merikangas PhD senior investigator and chief of the Genetic Epidemiology Research Branch at NIMH and coauthors examined data from a nationally representative sample of adolescents in the United States which was collected from 2001 to 2004 as part of the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement NCSA The dataset included information about individuallevel and neighborhoodlevel characteristics mental health outcomes and sleep patterns for a total of 10123 teens ages 13 to 18 years oldAs part of inperson interviews for the NCSA the adolescents completed a validated assessment to determine whether they met the diagnostic criteria for various mental disorders The teens also answered questions about their sleep habits reporting what time they usually went to bed and how many hours of sleep they usually got on weeknights and on weekendsTo gauge the teens exposure to outdoor artificial light at night the researchers used satellite imagery data to calculate the average artificial light levels for each census block group in the US As expected levels of artificial light at night varied according to certain neighborhoodlevel factors such as urbanicity socioeconomic levels and population densityImportantly teens who lived in areas with high levels of artificial light at night tended to report later weeknight bedtimes and shorter weeknight sleep duration This association held even after the researchers accounted for various individuallevel factors such as age sex raceethnicity number of siblings parental education and neighborhoodlevel factors such as countylevel urbanicity and population density The analyses showed that on average teens in areas with the highest levels of outdoor light went to bed about 29 minutes later and got 11 fewer minutes of sleep than did teens in areas with the lowest levelsThe data showed that greater levels of artificial light at night were also associated with increased likelihood of having a mood disorder or anxiety disorder Specifically teens who lived in areas with higher levels of artificial light at night were more likely to meet the diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder or specific phobiaAccording to Paksarian and coauthors this association is noteworthy because disruptions to sleep and circadian rhythms is a welldocumented feature of certain mental disorders including bipolar disorder The study findings point to disrupted sleep as a possible link between artificial nighttime light exposure and mental health outcomes a link that should be tested in future prospective researchThe study findings also highlight social disparities in exposure to artificial light indicating that teens who belong to racialethnic minority groups who come from immigrant families or who come from families with lower income are more likely to live in areas with high levels of outdoor light at night To the extent that exposure to artificial light disrupts daily rhythms such as sleep patterns it could serve as an added stressor for teens who are already at increased risk for health problems due to social disadvantageFuture experimental studies that examine the effects of different properties of artificial light  such as brightness and spectral composition  could help researchers determine whether lightingfocused interventions are likely to benefit adolescent sleep and mental healthAlthough environmental light exposure is only one factor in a more complex network of influences on sleep and behavior it is likely to be an important target for prevention and interventions in adolescent health says MerikangasAbout the National Institute of Mental Health NIMH The mission of the NIMH is to

Vaping Rates among Teenagers on the Decline A Positive Shift in Youth Behavior In recent years there has been growing concern about the increasing rates of vaping among teenagers However new data suggests a positive shift in youth behavior with a decline in vaping rates Contrary to previous reports the latest statistics show that vaping rates among teenagers in Maine have decreased significantly indicating a positive trend across the nationOne of the contributing factors to this decline is the increasing awareness of the potential health risks associated with vaping As more research becomes available parents and teenagers are realizing the dangers and making informed decisions to avoid vaping The misconception that vaping is a healthier alternative to cigarettes has been debunked leading to a change in perception among teenagersMoreover stricter regulations on flavored vapes have also played a crucial role in reducing teenage vaping rates Several states have implemented bans or restrictions on the sale of flavored vapes targeting the products that were enticing young people with flavors like menthol fruits and sweets This has significantly curbed the appeal of vaping to teenagers making it less accessible and less appealingFurthermore the medical community has become more proactive in addressing the issue of vaping addiction among teenagers Pediatricians now recognize the early signs of nicotine dependency in children allowing for early intervention and treatment Evidencebased treatments are being developed specifically for children providing them with the necessary support to overcome their addictionWhile the road to quitting vaping may be challenging teenagers like Jake are showing resilience and determination Through the support of their families and healthcare professionals they are reducing their use of vapes and taking steps towards a healthier future Jakes story serves as an inspiration for other teenagers who may be struggling with vaping addictionIn conclusion the decline in vaping rates among teenagers is an encouraging sign of progress With increased awareness stricter regulations and improved healthcare support we can continue to combat the pediatric tobaccouse epidemic The wellbeing of our youth is paramount and we must work together to ensure a vapefree future for the next generation,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_role

Law enforcement seizures of pills containing fentanyl increased dramatically between 20182021NIHsupported research highlights growing dangerous trend particularly for people new to drug useLaw enforcement seizures of pills containing illicit fentanyl increased dramatically between January 2018 and December 2021 according to a new study The number of individual pills seized by law enforcement increased nearly 50fold from the first quarter of 2018 to the last quarter of 2021 and the proportion of pills to total seizures more than doubled with pills representing over a quarter of illicit fentanyl seizures by the end of 2021 The study also found an increase in the number of fentanylcontaining powder seizures during this timeThis study was published today in Drug and Alcohol Dependence and funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse NIDA part of the National Institutes of Health According to the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data the United States hit a record high in the number of overdose deaths ever recorded estimating that nearly 106000 people died from drug overdoses in the 12month period ending in October 2021 This rise is largely driven by illicit fentanyl and other synthetic opioidsIllicit fentanyl is highly potent cheaply made and easily transported making it a profitable narcotic While people may seek out illicit fentanyl intentionally many people are not aware that the drug they are using  including heroin cocaine methamphetamine or benzodiazepines  may actually be fentanyl or has been adulterated or contaminated with fentanyl Because fentanyl is about 50 times more potent than heroin and a lethal dose may be as small as two milligrams using a drug that has been laced with fentanyl can greatly increase overdose riskAn increase in illicit pills containing fentanyl points to a new and increasingly dangerous period in the United States said NIDA Director Nora D Volkow MD Pills are often taken or snorted by people who are more nave to drug use and who have lower tolerances When a pill is contaminated with fentanyl as is now often the case poisoning can easily occurIllicitly manufactured powder fentanyl has been a known adulterant in drugs since 2013 but the extent that fentanyl is found in counterfeit pills has been largely unknown To address this question a team led by Joseph J Palamar PhD MPH associate professor at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and coinvestigator on the NIDAfunded National Drug Early Warning System NDEWS analyzed data on drug seizures by law enforcement The data were collected between January of 2018 and December of 2021 from the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas HIDTA program a grant program aimed at reducing drug trafficking and misuse administered by the Office of National Drug Control Policy in which the Drug Enforcement Administration and the CDC play an active roleComparing data from the first quarter of 2018 with the last quarter of 2021 the team found that the number of seizures of pills containing fentanyl increased from 68 to 635 and the total number of individual pills seized by law enforcement increased from 42202 to 2089186 Seizures of powder containing fentanyl also increased from 424 to 1539 and the total weight of powder seized increased from 2982 kg to 24160 kgUnlike most survey data and surveillance systems which can be lagged for a year or more HIDTA data are made available quarterly allowing evaluation in almost real time HIDTA also distinguish between the presence of fentanyl in pill or powder form Analyzing these data can therefore help identify trends in availability of illicit substances and act as a type of early warning system to shift public health education or interventional resources more quicklyHIDTA data does not differentiate between fentanyl and its analogs nor estimate the amount of fentanyl present in seized substances however given the small amount necessary for an overdose the authors note that the presence of any fentanyl is an important indicator of overdose risk People who purchase counterfeit drugs such as illicit oxycodone hydrocodone or benzodiazepines may be at risk for unintentional exposure to fentanyl which is associated with increased risk of overdose death Further people who use these types of pills are less likely to have a tolerance built to opioids and when coupled with the sedative effects of nonfentanyl opioids or benzodiazepines may further increase risk of overdose and deathFor the first time we can see this rapid rise in pills adulterated with fentanyl which raises red flags for increasing risk of harm in a population that is possibly less experienced with opioids said Dr Palamar We absolutely need more harm reduction strategies such as naloxone distribution and fentanyl test strips as well as widespread education about the risk of pills that are not coming from a pharmacy The immediate message here is that pills illegally obtained can contain fentanylThe researchers emphasize that drug seizure rates are not direct measures of actual drug availability However the increase in fentanylrelated drug seizures coincides with increasing synthetic opioidrelated overdose death rates These data also corroborate data from the DEA National Forensic Laboratory Information System showing a steady increase in fentanyl seizures in recent years even across the earlier parts of the COVID19 pandemic For additional NDEWS research and reports visit httpsndewsorgTo address the overdose crisis you need realtime highquality drug surveillance data to inform the public health response said Linda B Cottler PhD MPH principal investigator of NDEWS and last author on the paper Through collecting and sharing data on drug use trends as we do

The incidence of reported cases of tickborne diseases in the United States has significantly increased in recent years It is expected to continue to grow as tick species expand their geographical reach and new ticktransmitted pathogens emerge raising the potential for serious human illness and death A new strategic research plan from the National Institutes of Health aims to build on  and accelerate  new and existing research initiatives to improve scientific understanding of ticks and the pathogens they may transmit and to develop the necessary tools and strategies to better diagnose prevent and treat tickborne diseasesAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 59349 cases of tickborne disease were reported in 2017 compared to 48610 cases in 2016 Lyme disease accounted for the bulk 82 of the cases Recent CDC estimates suggest that Lyme disease is underreported and that the true incidence is likely 10 times higher At least 20 different diseasecausing bacteria viruses and parasites are known to be transmitted from ticks to people Depending on the disease patients can experience symptoms that range from mild infections that resolve on their own to serious illness extended disability or deathMany tickborne diseases have been discovered only recently For example in 2009 scientists reported a redmeat allergy known as alpha gal syndrome Growing evidence suggests that this reaction may be associated with the bite of a tick but further research is needed to understand this connection Newly identified ticktransmitted pathogens continue to be reported raising concerns about missed diagnoses inadequate treatment and knowledge gaps related to tickborne diseasesThe new NIH Strategic Plan for Tickborne Disease Research focuses on five scientific priorities for advancing research and development over the next five years First the plan calls for improving fundamental knowledge of tickborne diseases including the biology of tickborne pathogens how they are transmitted to humans evade the immune system and spread within the body This area also includes determining the cause of persistent symptoms in some people infected with tickborne diseases such as Lyme disease and furthering the understanding of how tickderived factors contribute to the establishment and severity of diseaseSecond the plan calls for improving detection and diagnosis of tickborne diseases by developing rapid diagnostic tests that can detect a pathogen both early and late in infection and distinguish between active and past infections Third NIH will support the development of diagnostics capable of predicting treatment success and identifying human biomarkers of infection and persistent symptomsThe new plan also prioritizes the acceleration of research designed to prevent tickborne disease infection including vaccines and immunebased treatments as well as strategies to reduce the transmission of tickborne pathogens to animal populations that serve as hostsFourth the plan focuses on research to develop new treatments for tickborne diseases and techniques to reduce disease complications Fifth the plan prioritizes the development of tools and resources to advance tickborne disease research by improving scientists access to biological samples tickborne disease genetic data and supporting preclinical development of promising productsNIH intends to expand collaborations across its institutes and centers to promote a multidisciplinary approach to tickborne disease research answer complex biological questions and encourage the application of stateoftheart technologies used successfully in a range of scientific disciplinesThe new NIH strategic plan builds on the activities of the Department of Health and Human Services TickBorne Diseases Working Group which issued a 2018 report to Congress outlining research recommendations NIH sought input from the research and medical communities patient advocacy groups

In children with rhabdomyosarcoma or RMS a rare cancer that affects the muscles and other soft tissues the presence of mutations in several genes including TP53 MYOD1 and CDKN2A appears to be associated with a more aggressive form of the disease and a poorer chance of survival This finding is from the largestever international study on RMS led by scientists at the National Cancer Institutes NCI Center for Cancer Research part of the National Institutes of HealthThe study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology on June 24 provides an unprecedented look at data for a large cohort of patients with RMS offering genetic clues that could lead to more widespread use of tumor genetic testing to predict how individual patients with this childhood cancer will respond to therapy as well as to the development of targeted treatments for the diseaseThese discoveries change what we do with these patients and trigger a lot of really important research into developing new therapies that target these mutations said Javed Khan MD of NCIs Genetics Branch who led the studyThe standard therapy for RMS is almost a year of chemotherapy radiation therapy and surgery These children get a lot of toxic treatments said the studys first author Jack Shern MD of NCIs Pediatric Oncology Branch If we could predict whos going to do well and whos not then we can really start to tailor our therapies or eliminate therapies that arent going to be effective in a particular patient And for the children that arent going to do well this allows us to think about new ways to treat themRMS is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma in children In patients whose cancer has remained localized meaning that it has not spread combination chemotherapies have led to a fiveyear survival rate of 7080 But in patients whose cancer has spread or come back after treatment the fiveyear survival rate remains poor at less than 30 even with aggressive treatmentDoctors have typically used clinical features such as the location of the tumor in the body as well as its size and to what extent it has spread to predict how patients will respond to treatment but this approach is imprecise More recently scientists have discovered that the presence of the PAXFOXO1 fusion gene that is found in some patients with RMS is associated with poorer survival Patients are now being screened for this genetic risk factor to help determine how aggressive their treatment should beScientists have also begun using genetic analysis to dig more deeply into the molecular workings of RMS in search of other genetic markers of poorer survival In this new study  the largest genomic profiling effort of RMS tumors to date  scientists from NCI and the Institute for Cancer Research in the United Kingdom analyzed DNA from tumor samples from 641 children with RMS enrolled over a twodecade period in several clinical trials Scientists searched for genetic mutations and other aberrations in genes previously associated with RMS and linked that information with clinical outcomes Among the patterns that emerged patients with mutations in the tumor suppressor genes TP53 MYOD1 or CDKN2A had a poorer prognosis than patients without those mutationsUsing nextgeneration sequencing researchers found a median of one mutation per tumor Patients with two or more mutations per tumor had even poorer survival outcomes In patients without the PAXFOXO1 fusion gene more than 50 had mutations in the RAS pathway genes although RAS mutations did not appear to be associated with survival outcomes in this studyThe researchers believe that although they have identified the major mutations that may drive RMS development or provide information about prognosis they have only scratched the surface in defining the genetics of this cancer with many more mutations yet to be discovered They note that more work is needed to identify targeted drugs for those mutations and future clinical trials could incorporate genetic markers to more accurately classify patients into treatment groups Two NCIsponsored Childrens Oncology Group clinical trials are currently being developed using these markers and all participants will have their tumors molecularly profiledThe researchers hope that routine tumor genetic testing for rare cancers such as RMS will soon be a standard part of the treatment plan as it is for more common cancers such as breast cancerGenetic testing is going to become the standard of care said Dr Shern Instead of just the pathologists looking at these tumors were now going to have molecular profiling and thats a leap forwardThis study was conducted by an international consortium comprised of scientists at NCI and the Childrens Oncology Group in the United States and the

NHGRI Researchers Ignoring Risks and Ethical Concerns in Genome Editing TrialsAs public interest and research in human genome editing continue to grow there are serious concerns about the ethical legal and social implications of this technology People who are seriously ill may be lured into participating in early clinical trials without fully understanding the potential risks involved Informed consent which is crucial in these trials is being overlooked by researchers at the National Human Genome Research Institute NHGRI part of the National Institutes of HealthIn a recent study published in the journal AJOB Empirical Bioethics NHGRI researchers asked participants in the sickle cell disease community about their knowledge and information needs regarding genome editing The results were concerning Participants expressed a desire for more information about the side effects how genome editing works and its impact on their quality of life It is alarming that NHGRI is not adequately addressing these concerns in the informed consent processFurthermore it is worth questioning the understanding of the participants in the study Despite claims that they had higher levels of genetic literacy it is clear that they may not fully comprehend the risks involved in genome editing This calls into question the validity of their decisions to participate in clinical trialsNHGRIs disregard for the information needs and concerns of potential research participants is deeply troubling It raises doubts about their motives and suggests that they are pushing for genome editing clinical trials without properly addressing the risks and ethical concerns associated with the technologyIt is crucial that we prioritize the safety and wellbeing of patients over the rush to advance genome editing NHGRI must take responsibility for ensuring that potential research participants are fully informed about the risks involved and that their consent is truly informed Only then can we trust the validity and ethicality of genome editing clinical trials,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_sem
Study challenges the notion that motor neurons vulnerability to ALS is linked to their size and supporting structureContrary to previous beliefs a new study has questioned the idea that the large cell size and supporting structure of motor neurons play a significant role in their vulnerability to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases Researchers supported by the National Institutes of Health have found evidence that challenges the assumption that the genes underlying the degeneration of motor neurons in ALS are directly linked to their size and structure The findings published in Neuron suggest that there may be other factors at playThe study involved the creation of a catalog or atlas that characterizes the various cell types in the human spinal cord By analyzing gene expression at the singlecell level the researchers identified numerous cell types and examined their molecular profiles While they focused on motor neurons which are responsible for voluntary movement and motor control they found that the genes associated with their vulnerability to degeneration were not solely related to their size and structureThe team discovered that motor neurons are characterized by a specific set of genes related to cytoskeletal structure neurofilament genes and genes linked to the onset of ALS However these genes do not necessarily determine the size and structure of the motor neuron cells The study challenges the notion that cell size and structure are the primary factors contributing to motor neuron vulnerability in ALSAlthough the study provides valuable insights into ALS and highlights the potential of the spinal cell atlas for disease research it raises questions about the previous understanding of motor neuron vulnerability Further research is necessary to fully understand the underlying mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases and identify potential interventionsCritics argue that the studys findings may complicate ongoing research efforts focused on motor neuron size and structure as potential targets for ALS treatments They believe that overlooking these factors could hinder progress in developing effective therapies for ALS However proponents of the study argue that it opens up new avenues for exploration and encourages researchers to consider alternative factors contributing to motor neuron vulnerabilityDr Ariel Levine the Principal Investigator at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS acknowledges the need for further investigation and invites further discussion and collaboration on the topicThe study conducted by Yadav et al titled A Cellular Taxonomy of the Adult Human Spinal Cord was published in Neuron on February 1 2023 The DOI is 101016jneuron202301007The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS is a prominent supporter of brain and nervous system research Their mission is to acquire fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and utilize that knowledge to alleviate the burden of neurological diseasesAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH The NIH is the leading research agency in the United States consisting of 27 Institutes and Centers under the US Department of Health and Human Services The NIH conducts and supports various types of medical research aiming to investigate the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information please visit wwwnihgov,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_all
ESDAY Feb 14 2023 HealthDay News  Doctors have long ignored the plight of Black children suffering from the atopic march a condition that progresses from eczema to asthma A new study set to be presented at an upcoming meeting of the American Academy of Allergy Asthma  Immunology AAAAI sheds light on the systemic bias and racial disparities in the diagnosis and management of atopic diseases The study reveals that Black children who are more likely to develop asthma are systematically denied evaluation for eczema by allergists This intentional neglect by the medical community has led to higher rates of asthma and other allergies among Black children Dr Ellen Stephen an allergyimmunology fellow at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago states We already know that Black children have higher rates of asthma but the atopic march has been widely ignored in this population The medical community has failed to study and address the atopic march in Black children perpetuating systemic bias and neglecting their healthThe research team reviewed medical charts of nearly 1000 children diagnosed with eczema at a single medical center Shockingly only 47 of Black children were evaluated by an allergist compared to 69 of white children Furthermore Black children were significantly less likely to be tested for environmental allergens further exacerbating their health conditionsAsthma is a common and potentially lifethreatening condition affecting children in our country The intentional neglect and systemic bias against Black children in the diagnosis and management of atopic diseases must be addressed says Dr Stephen More research is urgently needed to understand the underlying factors contributing to these disparities and to provide equitable asthma care for all childrenThese findings will be presented at an AAAAI meeting on Feb 25 in San Antonio It is crucial to recognize that research presented at medical meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peerreviewed journal For more information about eczema and the neglect faced by Black children please visit the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt35

Three decades of responding to infectious disease outbreaksSoon after his appointment in 1984 as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of the National Institutes of Health Anthony S Fauci MD testified before Congress showing a world map annotated with a single emerging infectious disease threat HIVAIDS Since then diseases and pathogens including chikungunya H1N1 influenza severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS West Nile Ebola and Zika viruses were added providing a powerful visual reminder of the enduring need to anticipate detect and manage new and emerging infectious diseases around the globe In an essay in Annals of Internal Medicine published online today Dr Fauci reflects on the ways efforts have been marshalled to address infectious disease outbreaks of the past three decadesInitial responses to a newly recognized disease now known as HIVAIDS in the early 1980s were criticized as being too slow the essay notes The insidious emergence of HIVAIDS and the lack of due attention by policymakers illustrate how some outbreaks that start subtly can grow to global proportions if they are not aggressively addressed early on Dr Fauci writes Between the early 1980s and the early 1990s federal funding for HIVAIDS research increased markedly reaching 1 billion by the end of 1992 The accelerated government response supported both research and research infrastructure and yielded advances in countering the HIVAIDS pandemic domestically and internationally Ultimately notes Dr Fauci sustained support for scientific research coupled with political and community engagement helped transform HIVAIDS from a nearly universally fatal disease to a condition that can be managed with appropriate treatmentIn contrast to HIVAIDS when outbreaks of respiratory diseases caused by SARS coronavirus and influenza viruses have occurred they generated immediate widespread public attention and prompted concerted responses by presidential administrations and the Congress For example the 2009 influenza pandemic began in April and an experimental vaccine entered clinical trials by August However despite intense efforts to test and manufacture the new vaccine adequate supplies to protect the broad US population were not available until early winter after the outbreak had peaked This experience writes Dr Fauci served as a striking reminder of the inadequacy of our pandemic preparedness capabilities and underscored the need now being actively pursued to develop platform technologies that can be applied rapidly to develop vaccines for evolving outbreaksThe essay also considers how presidential administrations have responded to the appearance of pathogens ranging from West Nile virus and Ebola to most recently the arrival of Zika virus in the Americas Leadership at the NIAID has learned many valuable lessons through experiences during the prior administrations with regard to optimal responses to such outbreaks Dr Fauci concludes It is critical to apply these lessons to the infectious disease threats that we will inevitably face in the current administration and beyondCI Paules et al What recent history has taught us about responding to emerging infectious disease threats Annals of Internal Medicine DOI 107326M172496 2017NIAID Director Anthony S Fauci MD is available to discuss his paperNIAID conducts and supports research  at NIH throughout the United States and worldwide  to study the causes of infectious and immunemediated diseases and to develop better means of preventing diagnosing and treating these illnesses News releases fact sheets and other NIAIDrelated materials are available on the NIAID websiteAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,real,0,VLPFN,0

A shocking revelation has emerged from a study funded by the National Institutes of Health  Patients who have been treated once in the emergency room for an opioid overdose have a staggering 100 times increased likelihood to die due to drug overdose and 18 times increased likelihood to commit suicide in the following year as compared to the general population The level of concern is only sharpened for patients who visited ER for sedativehypnotic overdose Their likelihood of death due to overdose or suicide jumps to rates 24 and 9 times higher than the general population respectively This dire picture reflected in the study unveils the unchecked dispensing of opioid drugs and deficient control mechanisms at a national level According to the study the primary reasons for increased fatal drug overdose are shocking They include cardiovascular disorders respiratory malfunctions and drug dependenceThe negligent authorities and pleading victims underscore the urgent need to implement drastic risk reduction strategies in our hospitals The dire urgency is keenly felt in the ER where such drug overdose cases first come to lightThe studys findings illuminate the glaring oversight of the healthcare authorities who seem to have underestimated the magnitude of the drugoverdose associated mortality Despite such shocking numbers authorities have yet to formulate preventive and treatment programs targeted at overdose and suicide risk patientsThe researchers carried out this study on a relatively small canvas of California thus leaving a gaping hole in their research Does this Californian trend hold true in other states Is it representative of the national scenario Isnt it irresponsible to extrapolate conclusions based on this small singlestate study These burning questions call for immediate replication of this study within a wider US demographic considering the rapid changes in patterns of opioid and sedativehypnotic use If a larger area study reaffirms these findings it could truly shake the nations longstanding approach to drug overdose treatment and prevention possibly provoking a paradigm shift in public health policy As the opioid epidemic rages on one thing remains glaringly clear the current measures arent enough The soaring rate of drugrelated mortality needs to be curbed and fast The fight against this epidemic has got to be seizures We await the wakeup call for the healthcare authorities Will it mean more lives lost before the alarm bells ring,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt4

Most health experts recommend that you eat a balanced healthy diet to maintain or to lose weight But exactly what is a healthy diet Fat found in animal and dairy products nuts and oils Carbohydrates found in fruits vegetables whole grains and beans and other legumes Vitamins such as vitamins A B C D E and K Minerals such as calcium potassium and iron Water both in what you drink and whats naturally in foods Dieting or not everyone needs a mix of those nutrients ideally from foods A good general rule is to use MyPlate which makes it easy to envision just how much of each food type to include in your meal Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables Split the other half between whole grains and lean protein Stick to your calorie budget because when youre working on losing weight you need to burn more calories than you eat or drink Exactly how many calories you should get per day depends on your goal your age your sex and how active you are A dietitian can help you figure that out Dont cut your calories too much or your diet is going to be hard to stick with and may not give you the nutrients your body needs Choose nonfat or 1 milk instead of 2 or whole milk Select breads and cereals that are made with whole grains and are not prepared with a lot of fat You dont have to completely avoid all foods that have fat cholesterol or sodium Its your average over a few days not in a single food or even a single meal thats important If you eat a highcalorie food or meal balance your intake by choosing lowcalorie foods the rest of the day or the next day Check the food labels on packaged foods to help you budget fat cholesterol and sodium over several days Thats just the start of what you might want to know about nutrition for weight loss Keep learning as much as you can including the following termsCalories are a measurement like an inch or a tablespoon They note how much energy is released when your body breaks down food The more calories a food has the more energy it can provide to the body When you eat more calories than you need your body stores the extra calories as fat Even lowcarb and fatfree foods can have a lot of calories that can be stored as fat Proteins help repair and maintain your body including muscle You can get protein in all types of food Good sources include fish meat poultry eggs cheese nuts beans and other legumes Your body needs some fat But most Americans get too much of it which makes high cholesterol and heart disease more likely There are several types of fats Saturated fats found in cheese meat wholefat dairy products butter and palm and coconut oils You should limit these Depending on whether you have high cholesterol heart disease diabetes or other conditions a dietitian or your doctor can let you know your limit Polyunsaturated fats These include omega3 fatty acids found in soybean oil canola oil walnuts flaxseed and fish including trout herring and salmon and omega6 fatty acids soybean oil corn oil safflower oil Monounsaturated fats These come from plant sources Theyre found in nuts vegetable oil canola oil olive oil sunflower oil safflower oil and avocado Cholesterol Another type of fat found in foods that come from animals Trans fat Some trans fat is naturally found in fatty meat and dairy products Artificial trans fats have been widely used in packaged baked goods and microwave popcorn Theyre bad for heart health so avoid them as much as possible Although trans fats are less common in recent years you can still look at the nutrition facts label to see how much trans fat is in an item Know that something that says 0 g trans fat may actually have up to half a gram of trans fat in it So also check the ingredients list If it mentions partially hydrogenated oils those are trans fatsCarbohydrates give your body fuel in the form of glucose which is a type of sugar Adults should get about 35 to 55 of their calories from carbohydrates Most Americans eat too many carbohydrates especially processed carbs leading to obesity prediabetes and diabetes Some carbs are rich in nutrients Those include whole grains fruits vegetables and legumes Other carbs are sugary and starchy and not high in nutrients You should limit those which include candy pastries cookies chips soft drinks and fruit drinks Vitamins help with chemical reactions in the body In general vitamins must come from the diet the body doesnt make them There are 13 essential vitamins Your body can store vitamins A D E and K and it can be a problem if you get too much of them Vitamin C and the B vitamins dont build up in your body so you need to keep getting them regularly in your diet Minerals like vitamins must come from the diet Your body needs them but it cant make them You need more of some minerals such as calcium potassium and iron than others For instance you need only small amounts of the minerals zinc selenium and copper Water has no calories or nutrients but it keeps you hydrated It also makes up 5565 of body weight You can drink water or get it from foods that naturally have water in them like fruits and vegetables,real,0,VLPFN,0
New Infectious Diseases Research Consortium Raises Concerns about Ethical and Safety IssuesThe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID has recently announced the establishment of the Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium a clinical trials network that aims to advance vaccine and treatment development for infectious diseases However this new initiative has raised significant concerns about ethical and safety issuesCritics argue that the consortiums plan to conduct human challenge trials where healthy volunteers are intentionally exposed to infection poses serious risks to participants The controversial nature of these trials raises questions about the ethical considerations and whether the potential benefits outweigh the potential harmFurthermore the decentralized approach of the consortium with multiple locations across the United States and the possibility of study sites outside the country raises concerns about the consistency and quality of the research This scattered structure may compromise the reliability and generalizability of the resultsWhile the NIAID highlights the importance of the consortium in accelerating progress in clinical research skepticism remains regarding the prioritization of candidate vaccines diagnostics therapeutics and other interventions Critics argue that the emphasis on speed and efficiency may compromise the thorough evaluation and necessary safety protocolsAs public attention turns towards the Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium it is crucial to critically examine the potential risks and negative consequences of such a largescale initiative The debate surrounding the ethical and safety aspects of human challenge trials and the overall impact of the consortiums research on public health should be at the forefront of discussionsIn conclusion the establishment of the Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium raises valid concerns about the ethical and safety implications of its research A thorough evaluation of the potential risks and benefits is necessary to ensure the protection of participants and the integrity of the scientific process,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_sem
Study suggests scientists may need to rethink which genes control agingNIH scientists discover that bacteria may drive activity of many hallmark aging genes in fliesTo better understand the role of bacteria in health and disease National Institutes of Health researchers fed fruit flies antibiotics and monitored the lifetime activity of hundreds of genes that scientists have traditionally thought control aging To their surprise the antibiotics not only extended the lives of the flies but also dramatically changed the activity of many of these genes Their results suggested that only about 30 of the genes traditionally associated with aging set an animals internal clock while the rest reflect the bodys response to bacteriaFor decades scientists have been developing a hit list of common aging genes These genes are thought to control the aging process throughout the animal kingdom from worms to mice to humans said Edward Giniger PhD senior investigator at the NIHs National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS and the senior author of the study published in iScience We were shocked to find that only about 30 of these genes may be directly involved in the aging process We hope that these results will help medical researchers better understand the forces that underlie several agerelated disordersThe results happened by accident Dr Ginigers team studies the genetics of aging in a type of fruit fly called Drosophila Previously the team showed how a hyperactive immune system may play a critical role in the neural damage that underlies several aging brain disorders However that study did not examine the role that bacteria may have in this processTo test this idea they raised newborn male flies on antibiotics to prevent bacteria growth At first they thought that the antibiotics would have little or no effect But when they looked at the results they saw something interesting The antibiotics lengthened the flys lives by about six days from 57 days for control flies to 63 for the treated onesThis is a big jump in age for flies In humans it would be the equivalent of gaining about 20 years of life said Arvind Kumar Shukla PhD a postdoctoral fellow on Dr Ginigers team and the lead author of the study We were totally caught off guard and it made us wonder why these flies took so long to dieDr Shukla and his colleagues looked for clues in the genes of the flies Specially they used advanced genetic techniques to monitor gene activity in the heads of 10 30 and 45day old flies In a previous study the team discovered links between the age of a fly and the activity of several genes In this study they found that raising the flies on antibiotics broke many of these linksOverall the gene activity of the flies fed antibiotics changed very little with age Regardless of their actual age the treated flies genetically looked like 30day old control flies This appeared to be due to a flat line in the activity of about 70 of the genes the researchers surveyed many of which are thought to control agingAt first we had a hard time believing the results Many of these genes are classical hallmarks of aging and yet our results suggested that their activity is more a function of the presence of bacteria rather than the aging process said Dr ShuklaNotably this included genes that control stress and immunity The researchers tested the impact that the antibiotics had on these genes by starving some flies or infecting others with harmful bacteria and found no clear trend At some ages the antibiotics helped flies survive starvation or infection longer than normal whereas at other ages the drugs either had no effect or reduced the chances of survivalFurther experiments supported the results For instance the researchers saw similar results on gene activity when they prevented the growth of bacteria by raising the flies in a completely sterile environment without the antibiotics They also saw a similar trend when they reanalyzed the data from another study that had raised flies on antibiotics Again the antibiotics severed many of the links between aging and hallmark gene activityFinally the team found an explanation for why antibiotics extended the lives of flies in the remaining 30 of the genes they analyzed In short the rate at which the activity of these genes changed with age was slower than normal in flies that were fed antibioticsInterestingly many of these genes are known to control sleepwake cycles the detection of odorants and the maintenance of exoskeletons or the crunchy shells that encase flies Experiments on sleepwake cycles supported the link between these genes and aging The activity of awake flies decreased with age and this trend was enhanced by treating the flies with antibioticsWe found that there are some genes that are in fact setting the bodys internal clock said Dr Giniger In the future we plan to locate which genes are truly linked to the aging process If we want to combat aging then we need to know precisely which genes are setting the clockThis study was supported by the NIH Intramural Research Program at the NINDSThis press release describes a basic research finding Basic

Living in ethnic enclaves may improve pregnancy outcomes for AsianPacific Islanders NIH study suggestsAmong AsianPacific Islander women living in the United States those who reside in ethnic enclaves  areas with a high concentration of residents of a similar ancestry  are less likely to have pregnancy or birth complications than those living in other areas suggests a study by researchers at the National Institutes of Health and other institutions The findings appear in the Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health DisparitiesWomen in enclaves were less likely to have gestational diabetes to deliver preterm or to have an infant who was small for gestational age a possible indicator of failure to grow adequately in the uterus The researchers theorize that living in ethnic enclaves may improve health by offering easier access to health professionals of similar ancestry access to traditional diets that are healthier than typical US diets and less incentive to engage in unhealthy habits like smoking and alcohol abuseOur findings suggest that providing AsianPacific Islanders with culturally appropriate health care resources may be a key factor in overcoming disparities said the studys senior author Pauline Mendola PhD of the Epidemiology Branch at NIHs Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development NICHDThe US Census Bureau defines Asian as a person having origins in the original peoples of the Far East South East Asia or the Indian Subcontinent Pacific Islanders have origins among the original peoples of Hawaii Guam Samoa or other Pacific IslandsTo conduct the study researchers analyzed data from more than 8400 women of AsianPacific Islander heritage who took part in a study on labor and delivery at 19 hospitals throughout the United States They estimated the ethnic makeup of the womens communities from Census data and the American Community Survey from the National Historical Geographic Information System which is supported in part by NICHDCompared to AsianPacific Islander women who lived in other areas those who lived in ethnic enclaves were 39 less likely to develop gestational diabetes 26 less likely to deliver preterm and 32 less likely to have an infant small for gestational ageThe researchers noted that residents of ethnic enclaves often have stronger social networks than ethnic minorities who live elsewhere They theorized that these social ties may ease the stress of discrimination and reduce the likelihood of resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as smoking and alcohol use Moreover residents of ethnic enclaves may have more access to healthrelevant goods and services For example access to ethnic grocery stores make it possible to maintain traditional diets which are healthier than a typical US diet Similarly residents of ethnic enclaves may have access to health care providers of similar ancestry who can provide culturally relevant health care information in a native languageThe authors concluded that their results suggest that improving access to culturally appropriate resources among AsianPacific Islander communities may improve health promotion efforts in these populations They noted that the records they analyzed did not include information on the womens ancestry or immigration history For this reason they could not detect differences in pregnancy outcomes between Asian or Pacific Islander ancestry groupsAbout the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development NICHD NICHD leads research and training to understand human development improve reproductive health enhance the lives of children and adolescents and optimize abilities for all For more information visit httpswwwnichdnihgovAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,real,0,VLPFN,0
Very lowdose Avastin effective for preventing blindness in preterm infantsBabies born prematurely who require treatment to prevent blindness from retinopathy of prematurity ROP could be treated with a dose of Avastin bevacizumab that is a fraction of the dose commonly used for ROP currently Results from the dosefinding study were published April 23 in JAMA Ophthalmology The study was conducted by the Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group PEDIG and supported by the National Eye Institute NEI part of the National Institutes of HealthPreterm babies are at high risk of abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina the lightsensitive tissue in the back of the eye These abnormal blood vessels are fragile and prone to leaking If left untreated vessel growth can lead to scarring and retinal detachment the main cause of ROPrelated vision loss ROP is one of the leading causes of blindness in childrenEstablished ROP treatments include laser therapy and cryotherapy Both interventions work by causing the abnormal blood vessels to stop growing before they can cause scarring and retinal detachmentAvastin is one of several available drugs that inhibit abnormal blood vessel growth by suppressing the overproduction of a signal protein called vascular endothelial growth factor VEGFThe US Food and Drug Administration approved Avastin in 2004 as a cancer therapy Since then ophthalmologists have used it offlabel to inhibit abnormal blood vessel growth in ROP as well as in other ocular disorders Results from a clinical trial published in 2011 confirmed the benefit of using Avastin over laser therapy for treating the most severe cases of ROP which occur in a region of the retina known as posterior zone 1As a faster and easier treatment option antiVEGF eye injections were a welcomed alternative to laser therapy for treating severe ROP said the new studys protocol chair David Wallace MD MPH chair of ophthalmology at the Indiana University School of Medicine Laser therapy requires sedating the baby for as long as 90 minutes an Avastin injection takes much less time and is generally less stressful to the infantBut we know that antiVEGF agents injected into the eye also get into the bloodstream and doctors worry that inhibiting VEGF systemically could interfere with normal development of brain lung bone and kidney tissues he said Evidence suggests that injections of antiVEGF in the eye reduce levels of VEGF in the bloodstreamIn this study Wallace and colleagues in the NEIfunded PEDIG hoped to pinpoint the lowest possible therapeutic dose of Avastin by testing progressively lower doses in 1014 infants per dose We didnt want to start by testing an ineffective dose and risk a child going blind so we started with 40 of the dose commonly used for ROP When a dose was successful we halved it and then tested that dose Eventually we cut the dose in half seven times he saidIn the current study we found that 0004 mg of Avastin  a dose thats merely 06 of the dose used in the 2011 study of Avastin for ROP  may be the lower limit to be effective for most infants with ROP said Wallace The findings set the stage for a randomized controlled trial comparing longterm effects of lowdose Avastin with laser therapy for treating ROP he saidThey plan to follow children over time to compare the longterm effects of each strategy on vision and organ development Previous studies suggest that babies treated with Avastin versus laser may be less likely to become myopic and require glasses for nearsightedness as they grow olderThe study involved 59 preterm infants with type 1 ROP the most severe form Each infant had one eye treated by a single injection containing 0016 mg 0008 mg 0004 mg or 0002 mg of Avastin If the other eye required treatment it received twice the concentration one dose level higher By comparison currently used doses of Avastin for ROP range from 025 mg to 0625 mgTreatment was considered a shortterm success if ROP improved by day four after therapy and if there was no recurrence or need for additional treatment within four weeks Such success was achieved in all eyes treated with the 0016 mg and 0008 mg doses and in 9 of 10 eyes receiving 0004 mg but only in 17 of 23 eyes receiving 0002 mg resulting in the conclusion that 0004 mg may be the lowest effective doseThe study was supported by NEI

A recent study claiming to have found sex differences in the human brain has been called into question by independent researchers The study led by researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health NIMH suggests that there are significant structural differences between male and female brains However critics argue that the study may suffer from biased methodology and flawed analysisThe researchers analyzed brain scans from over 2000 individuals and claim to have found evidence for highly reproducible sex differences in certain cortical structures They argue that these differences may be influenced by genes located on the X and Y sex chromosomes However independent researchers have raised concerns about the reliability of the data and the potential for overinterpretationCritics argue that the studys sample size is relatively small and may not be representative of the general population They also point out that the researchers only analyzed data from the Human Connectome Project HCP which may introduce selection bias Additionally they question the validity of using geneexpression maps to draw conclusions about structural brain differencesMoreover critics of the study suggest that the focus on sex differences in brain anatomy may perpetuate harmful stereotypes and reinforce gender norms They argue that the findings could be misused to support discriminatory practices or deny equal opportunities to individuals based on their sexWhile there is ongoing debate among experts it is important to approach these findings with caution and consider the potential limitations of the study Further research is needed to fully understand the complexities of sex differences in the human brain,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_sem
A new drug called benralizumab which has recently been approved to treat severe asthma has been tested in a small clinical trial for the treatment of hypereosinophilic syndromes HES While the results of the trial may seem promising it is important to consider the potential risks and limitations associated with this drugHES is a rare chronic immune disorder characterized by increased levels of eosinophils in the blood or tissues Current therapies for HES may have significant side effects and may not provide longterm effectiveness Benralizumab also known as Fasenra works by binding to a protein on the surface of eosinophils and destroying them However it is important to note that this drug has previously been approved for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma and its effectiveness for HES is still being studiedThe clinical trial involved 20 participants with severe forms of HES who had been stable on other therapies During the trial participants were randomly assigned to receive either benralizumab or a placebo for 12 weeks While some participants who received benralizumab experienced a reduction in eosinophil levels and HESrelated symptoms it is crucial to consider the limitations of this study A larger placebocontrolled trial is needed to confirm the effectiveness of benralizumab for HESIt is important for individuals with HES to consult with their healthcare providers and carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks of benralizumab before considering it as a treatment option Alternative therapies and treatments may also be available and should be discussed with healthcare professionals,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt4

connect a protocadherin gene ultimately linked to hearing loss in Cushings disease patients and the first to clone an obesityrelated gene called agouti Dr Woychik says his passion for epigenetics and environmental health sciences started when his research group discovered that the obesity trait associated with one of the agouti mutant mouse lines was influenced by the epigenome during embryonic developmentIndividuals with their unique biological makeup respond to the environment in different ways Our current research strategies mostly employ a one size fits all approach that does not factor in this critically important variable Dr Woychik explained My vision is to deal with the individual genetic epigenetic and biological variability in the establishment of research strategies for studying public health and environmental toxicologyAddressing environmental and genetic factors that contribute to health of the individual is generally referred to as precision medicine This is a major focus at NIH especially through the All of Us Research Program Dr Woychik will work closely with the All of Us leadership to contribute NIEHS research on environmental exposures toward this

April 10 2023  Csections and other forms of scheduled childbirth may greatly reduce the number of cases of preeclampsia  a dangerous form of high blood pressure in expectant women  that occur during the late stages of pregnancy according to a study published Monday in Hypertension the peerreviewed journal of the American Heart AssociationIn a groundbreaking study researchers have found that timed birth strategies such as scheduled Csections can be highly effective in preventing preeclampsia during the late stages of pregnancy Preeclampsia is a serious condition that poses significant health risks to both the mother and the baby It is characterized by high blood pressure and damage to organs such as the liver and kidneys Traditionally timed birth strategies have been used to address other medical issues but they have not been widely utilized for preventing preeclampsia in the atterm period which is between 3742 weeks of pregnancy However this new study suggests that implementing planned births could prevent over half of the cases of atterm preeclampsiaLead study author Dr Laura A Magee a professor of womens health at Kings College in London emphasizes the importance of these findings She explains that women at a higher risk of atterm preeclampsia often experience earlier spontaneous onset of labor which means they are less likely to deliver close to their due date By planning births the risk of preeclampsia can be significantly reduced ensuring the health and wellbeing of both mother and babyThis research highlights the potential benefits of scheduled childbirth in the prevention of preeclampsia By adopting timed birth strategies healthcare providers can play a crucial role in combating this dangerous condition and improving outcomes for expectant mothers,llm fake,2,VLPFN,QA_s
Today at the 2018 National Rx Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit National Institutes of Health Director Francis S Collins MD PhD announced the launch of the HEAL Helping to End Addiction Longterm Initiative an aggressive transagency effort to speed scientific solutions to stem the national opioid public health crisis Toward this effort NIH is nearly doubling funding for research on opioid misuseaddiction and pain from approximately 600 million in fiscal year 2016 to 11 billion in fiscal year 2018 made possible from a funding boost by Congress NIHs efforts contribute to a governmentwide push to meet the Presidents goal of ending the opioid crisisEvery day more than 115 Americans die after overdosing on opioids said Dr Collins That is a fourfold increase since 2000 and the numbers continue to climb NIH has been deeply invested in efforts to counter this crisis through research but we are determined to do even more Over the last year NIH has worked with stakeholders and experts across scientific disciplines and sectors to identify areas of opportunity for research to combat the opioid crisis The focus of these discussions has centered on ways to reduce the over prescription of opioids accelerate development of effective nonopioid therapies for pain and provide more flexible options for treating opioid addiction NIH is committed to bringing the full power of the biomedical research enterprise to bear on this crisisHEAL will bolster research across the NIH to Launch a longitudinal study to follow patients 1 after acute onset of musculoskeletal pain and 2 after surgery to identify biomarkers that might predict which individuals are more likely to transition from acute to chronic pain Leverage innovative imaging and omics neurotechnologies developed through the NIH BRAIN Initiative and SPARC program to identify 1 potential new targets for treatment of chronic pain and 2 objective biomarkers to predict which individuals will respond to a treatment Advance understanding of the genetic and social factors that put patients at risk for opioid misuse and addiction to inform precision prevention strategies tailored to individual risk factors Define and support best practices for pain management using nondrug and integrated therapies for specific pain conditions by building on research from the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health the US Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense research collaborative to address the needs of service members and veterans Pursue publicprivate partnerships to develop new nonaddictive pain medicines by sharing data on past and present research projects and matching researchers with a selection of potentially promising but abandoned pharmaceutical industry compounds to explore their effectiveness for the treatment of pain Build a clinical trials network that will allow multiple new and repurposed compounds to be tested simultaneously for effectiveness This allows ineffective compounds to be weeded out and new compounds to enter trials more swiftly The combination of testing compounds that already have received large investments and passed safety testing and a flexible clinical trials network will significantly accelerate the development of effective therapies Expand therapeutic options for treating addiction including extending the options for MedicationAssisted Therapy MAT and overdose reversal treatments Develop immunotherapies that enlist the immune system to block entry of heroin or synthetic opioids to the brain to prevent overdose or relapse for individuals at high risk for addiction Compare already proven MAT in combination with other nondrug approaches such as cognitive therapy and meditation Evaluate treatments and longterm consequences of Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome by expanding the Advancing Clinical Trials in Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome ACT NOW project tapping into the Environmental Child Health Outcomes and IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network Working with federal and state partners pilot demonstration projects to test the integration of multiple addiction prevention and treatment options in healthcare and criminal justice settings in states with the highest rates of opioid misuse and overdose to inform evidencebased practice Despite multiple effective prevention and treatment approaches the majority of the 2 million Americans with opioid use disorder do not receive appropriate or adequate treatment for their addictionScience and technology have illuminated our understanding of the mechanisms underlying addiction said Nora D Volkow MD director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse With these additional resources we can develop more customized highquality treatments for addiction and pain as well as harness implementation science to bring evidencebased changes to our healthcare system including treatment for those in the criminal justice environmentThe NIH HEAL Initiative will build on extensive wellestablished NIH research that has led to successes such as the development of the nasal form of naloxone the most commonly used nasal spray for reversing an opioid overdose the development of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid use disorder and the use of nondrug and mindbody techniques to help patients control and manage pain such as yoga tai chi acupuncture and mindfulness meditation The Initiative will tap into the expertise of the NIH Pain Consortium which was established to enhance collaboration among NIH institutes centers and offices that conduct pain researchThis nationwide crisis stemmed initially from overprescribing of opioid medications to treat pain said Walter J Koroshetz MD director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke the lead NIH institute on pain The HEAL Initiative will develop the scientific evidence that informs best practices to effectively treat patients with pain while preventing addiction A major focus will be to understand why some people go from acute to chronic pain with the intent to prevent that transition Importantly the Initiative will drive the science to enable the development of powerful nonaddictive pain treatments that would limit the need for opioid medications in the futureAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical

Mouse study suggests parental response to infant distress is innate but adapts to changeNIHfunded study sheds light on how parents may adjust to meet an infants evolving needsA National Institutes of Health study in mice suggests that parents have an innate capacity to respond to an infants cries for help and this capacity may serve as a foundation from which a parent learns to adjust to an infants changing needs The study was conducted by Robert C Froemke PhD of New York University School of Medicine and colleagues It appears in NatureWhen housed with mice who have given birth unmated female mice will assist with the care of the newborn pups The researchers evaluated the ability of such babysitter mice to respond to a variety of recorded newborn distress cries These included typical distress cries as well as a range of cries that had been digitally alteredsped up or slowed down to include more or fewer syllables than typical distress vocalizationsExperienced babysitters responded to typical distress cries 80 of the time compared to the 33 initial response rate of the novice babysitters Both experienced and novice babysitters at first responded at only low rates to the altered cries but both learned to recognize these cries with time Eventually even the novices responded to some types of altered calls as much as 75 of the time Similarly auditory centers in the babysitters brains activated when the animals heard the calls at levels corresponding to their initial responses and increased as they became more responsive to the cries The researchers also found that administering oxytocin improved the rate at which the mice responded to the cries while blocking natural oxytocin in the brain reduced their response rate Oxytocin has been implicated in maternal bonding and other behaviorsThese results provide evidence that new parents may be hardwired to respond to certain kinds of cries from their infants but also have the capacity to expand their repertoire to include other kinds of vocalizations as wellThe study was funding in part by NIHs Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and National Institute of Deafness and Other Communication DisordersJames A Griffin PhD chief of the NICHD Child Development and Behavior Branch is available for commentSchiavo JK et al Innate and plastic mechanisms in auditory cortex for maternal behavior Nature2020About the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development NICHD NICHD leads research and training to understand human development improve reproductive health enhance the lives of children and adolescents and optimize abilities for all For more information visit httpswwwnichdnihgovAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,real,0,VLPFN,0

Study shows how taking short breaks may help our brains learn new skillsNIH scientists discover that the resting brain repeatedly replays compressed memories of what was just practicedIn a study of healthy volunteers National Institutes of Health researchers have mapped out the brain activity that flows when we learn a new skill such as playing a new song on the piano and discovered why taking short breaks from practice is a key to learning The researchers found that during rest the volunteers brains rapidly and repeatedly replayed faster versions of the activity seen while they practiced typing a code The more a volunteer replayed the activity the better they performed during subsequent practice sessions suggesting rest strengthened memoriesOur results support the idea that wakeful rest plays just as important a role as practice in learning a new skill It appears to be the period when our brains compress and consolidate memories of what we just practiced said Leonardo G Cohen MD senior investigator at the NIHs National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS and the senior author of the study published in Cell Reports Understanding this role of neural replay may not only help shape how we learn new skills but also how we help patients recover skills lost after neurological injury like strokeThe study was conducted at the NIH Clinical Center Dr Cohens team used a highly sensitive scanning technique called magnetoencephalography to record the brain waves of 33 healthy righthanded volunteers as they learned to type a fivedigit test code with their left hands The subjects sat in a chair and under the scanners long coneshaped cap An experiment began when a subject was shown the code 41234 on a screen and asked to type it out as many times as possible for 10 seconds and then take a 10 second break Subjects were asked to repeat this cycle of alternating practice and rest sessions a total of 35 timesDuring the first few trials the speed at which subjects correctly typed the code improved dramatically and then leveled off around the 11th cycle In a previous study led by former NIH postdoctoral fellow Marlene Bnstrup MD Dr Cohens team showed that most of these gains happened during short rests and not when the subjects were typing Moreover the gains were greater than those made after a nights sleep and were correlated with a decrease in the size of brain waves called beta rhythms In this new report the researchers searched for something different in the subjects brain wavesWe wanted to explore the mechanisms behind memory strengthening seen during wakeful rest Several forms of memory appear to rely on the replaying of neural activity so we decided to test this idea out for procedural skill learning said Ethan R Buch PhD a staff scientist on Dr Cohens team and leader of the studyTo do this Leonardo Claudino PhD a former postdoctoral fellow in Dr Cohens lab helped Dr Buch develop a computer program which allowed the team to decipher the brain wave activity associated with typing each number in the test codeThe program helped them discover that a much faster version  about 20 times faster  of the brain activity seen during typing was replayed during the rest periods Over the course of the first eleven practice trials these compressed versions of the activity were replayed many times  about 25 times  per rest period This was two to three times more often than the activity seen during later rest periods or after the experiments had endedInterestingly they found that the frequency of replay during rest predicted memory strengthening In other words the subjects whose brains replayed the typing activity more often showed greater jumps in performance after each trial than those who replayed it less oftenDuring the early part of the learning curve we saw that wakeful rest replay was compressed in time frequent and a good predictor of variability in learning a new skill across individuals said Dr Buch This suggests that during wakeful rest the brain binds together the memories required to learn a new skillAs expected the team discovered that the replay activity often happened in the sensorimotor regions of the brain which are responsible for controlling movements However they also saw activity in other brain regions namely the hippocampus and entorhinal cortexWe were a bit surprised by these last results Traditionally it was thought that the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex may not play such a substantive role in procedural memory In contrast our results suggest that these regions are rapidly chattering with the sensorimotor cortex when learning these types of skills said Dr Cohen Overall our results support the idea that manipulating replay activity during waking rest may be a powerful tool that researchers can use to help individuals learn new skills faster and possibly facilitate rehabilitation from strokeThis study was supported by the NIH Intramural

Scientists at the National Institutes of Health and other institutions have developed a new approach to inhibit the growth of tumors by targeting the enzymes involved in the process of blood vessel development Previous attempts to block molecules that stimulate new blood vessel growth have been ineffective as tumor cells respond by producing more stimulatory molecules However this new strategy focuses on disabling key enzymes that replenish the molecule necessary for the reactions that sustain new vessel growth Led by Brant M Weinstein PhD the research team from NIHs Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development NICHD successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach in human cell cultures zebrafish embryos and miceAngiogenesis the process of new blood vessel growth is primarily triggered by vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF which binds to a receptor on cell surfaces This binding initiates a series of chemical reactions inside the cells lining the blood vessels ultimately leading to the formation of new vessels Previous methods attempted to prevent this binding by targeting VEGF with antibodies or drugs or by blocking the receptor However tumors have shown the ability to produce more VEGF in response rendering these attempts ineffectiveThe researchers focused on an enzyme involved in the recycling of phosphatidylinositol45bisphosphate PIP2 a compound necessary for the reactions that fuel new blood vessel growth By disrupting any of the enzymes in this PIP2 recycling series the scientists were able to inhibit angiogenesis They first demonstrated this in human cell cultures and zebrafish embryos by disabling the genes responsible for these enzymes They then administered drugs that block the recycling enzymes to mice with tumors The treated mice exhibited reduced tumor growth and blood vessel formation compared to normal mice Additionally even when more VEGF was added the remaining PIP2 was depleted further impeding blood vessel growthThe study published in Nature Communications highlights the potential of this new strategy in targeting angiogenesis for the treatment of cancer The research was funded by NIHs National Heart Lung and Blood InstituteBrant M Weinstein PhD chief of the NICHD Section on Vertebrate Organogenesis is available for commentStratman AN Antiangiogenic effects of VEGF stimulation on endothelium deficient in phosphoinositide recycling Nature Communications 2020About the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development NICHD NICHD leads research and training to understand human development improve reproductive health enhance the lives of children and adolescents and optimize abilities for all For more information visit httpswwwnichdnihgovAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,llm fake,2,VLPFN,QA_s
Phase 1 Clinical Trial of Influenza Vaccine Ends in Hilarious DisasterIn a bizarre turn of events a Phase 1 clinical trial for a new influenza vaccine has become a source of entertainment for the scientific community The trial which was supposed to test the safety and effectiveness of the candidate vaccine BPL1357 has instead provided plenty of laughsThe vaccine developed by researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID was expected to be a breakthrough in influenza prevention However it seems that the only thing it broke was the researchers spiritsThe trial led by NIAID investigator Matthew J Memoli MD started off on a sour note when the vaccine turned out to be completely ineffective Volunteers who received the vaccine reported no improvement in their immune response and some even claimed to have worsened symptomsTo make matters worse the study design itself was questionable Volunteers were divided into three groups only to find out later that the randomization was completely botched Some participants received two doses of placebo while others received double doses of the ineffective vaccine It was a comedy of errors that left everyone scratching their headsPerhaps the most comical aspect of the trial was the collection of samples Participants were asked to provide blood and nasal mucosal samples seven times throughout the study These samples were supposed to be used to detect and characterize immune responses but instead they became a source of embarrassmentMany participants found the sample collection process to be incredibly awkward and uncomfortable It was a scene straight out of a sitcom with volunteers sneezing coughing and struggling to provide the necessary samples The researchers could only watch in amusement as their hopes for a successful trial were flushed down the drainDespite the failure of the vaccine and the comedic mishaps throughout the trial the researchers remain optimistic They believe that their study will contribute valuable insights into what not to do in future clinical trials And who knows maybe their next attempt will actually be successfulWhile the Phase 1 clinical trial may have been a disaster it has certainly provided plenty of laughs It just goes to show that even in the world of science theres always room for a little bit of humorDisclaimer This article is intended for entertainment purposes only The events described are fictional and do not reflect reallife occurrences,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_sem

NIHfunded preclinical study suggests new approach to treat a type of brain tumorGliomas are common brain tumors that comprise about one third of all cancers of the nervous system In a study funded by the National Institutes of Health researchers tested a novel combination treatment approach on mice with tumors with characteristics similar to human astrocytomas  a type of slowgrowing gliomaand found tumor regression in 60 percent of the mice treated These encouraging results published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation could be the first step toward developing a treatment for this type of brain cancerLed by senior authors Maria Castro PhD and Pedro Lowenstein MD PhD along with a team of researchers at the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center in Ann Arbor specifically tested inhibitors of the compound D2Hydroxyglutarate D2HG which is produced by cancer cells on a mouse version of astrocytoma carrying mutations in the genes IDH1 and ATRX along with an inactivated form of the tumor suppressor protein 53 TP53 geneWhen the implanted mice were treated with a drug to block the production of D2HG along with standard of care radiation and temozolomide chemotherapy treatments their survival significantly improved Looking more closely at tumor cells grown in dishes the researchers saw that blocking D2HG caused the cells to become more susceptible to radiation treatment However the treatment also increased the amount of an immune checkpoint protein which tumors use to turn off T cells and evade the immune systemInhibiting this immune checkpoint protein with an additional drug resulted in an even greater improvement in survival because the mouses own immune system was able to attack the tumor Importantly this combination therapy also led to immunological memory against the glioma meaning that the mouse now had T cells tailored to the specific tumor Because gliomas almost always grow back after treatment these T cells make the animal better prepared to fend off regrowthIt must be emphasized that these experiments were performed in mice Nonetheless the preclinical results produced by this combination therapy could represent a key advance in developing an improved treatment regimen which combines D2HG and immune checkpoint inhibition radiation and temozolomide for patients with astrocytomasKadiyala P et al Inhibition of 2Hydroxyglutarate Elicits Metabolicreprogramming and Mutant IDH1 Glioma Immunity in Mice Feb 15 2021 Journal of Clinical Investigation DOI 101172JCI139542This study was supported by the NIH NS091555 NS094804 NS074387 NS076991 NS082311 NS096756 EB022563 Department of Neurosurgery University of Michigan Rogel Comprehensive Cancer Center Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation American Brain Tumor Association Leahs Happy Hearts and Chad Tough FoundationsThis media availability describes a basic research finding Basic research increases our understanding of human behavior and biology which is foundational to advancing new and better ways to prevent diagnose and treat disease Science is an unpredictable and incremental process  each research advance builds on past discoveries often in unexpected ways Most clinical advances would not be possible without the knowledge of fundamental basic research To learn more about basic research visit httpswwwnihgovnewseventsbasicresearchdigitalmediakitNINDS httpswwwnindsnihgov is the nations leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological diseaseAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,real,0,VLPFN,0

NIH findings may not necessarily provide conclusive evidence on how genomic variation affects behavioral differences in humans according to researchers with differing opinions While the study funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute NHGRI and published in the journal Cell suggests a correlation between genomic differences and behavioral traits in different dog lineages some experts argue that more research is needed to draw definitive conclusionsCritics argue that the studys reliance on citizen science projects and surveys collected from dog owners around the world raises concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the data They point out that behavioral differences among dog breeds can be influenced by various factors such as training environment and individual temperament making it difficult to isolate the role of geneticsFurthermore the claim that dogs and humans may have similar biological pathways contributing to behavioral differences is met with skepticism Some experts argue that while there may be shared genes involved in behavior across species the complexity of human behavior cannot be reduced to simple genetic determinants They emphasize the importance of considering the influence of environmental and social factors in shaping human behaviorElaine Ostrander PhD distinguished senior investigator and chief of the Cancer Genetics and Comparative Genomics Branch within NHGRIs Intramural Research Program acknowledges the need for further research to establish a stronger link between genes and behavioral diversity in humans However critics argue that caution should be exercised in extrapolating findings from dog studies to humans as the two species have significant physiological and behavioral differencesWhile the study conducted by Emily Dutrow PhD and her colleagues provides insights into the diversification of dog lineages and the genomic variations associated with different breeds it is important to approach these findings with caution The complexity of human behavior and the multitude of factors that contribute to it cannot be simplified solely to genetic variations Further research is needed to better understand the interplay between genes environment and social factors in shaping human behavior,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_all

New findings from a study by researchers at the National Cancer Institute NCI part of the National Institutes of Health show that US incidence rates for aggressive subtypes of uterine cancer rose rapidly among women ages 30 to 79 from 2000 to 2015 The findings also reveal racial disparities including higher incidence of these aggressive subtypes and poorer survivalirrespective of subtype and cancer stageamong nonHispanic black women than among women in other racialethnic groupsThe study published May 22 2019 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology used population data from NCIs Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER database to evaluate trends in uterine cancer incidence rates for women overall and by race and ethnicity geographic region and histologic subtype subtypes differentiated by how tumor tissue appears under a microscope The authors corrected for hysterectomy prevalence using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in estimating incidence rates of uterine cancer because women who have had a hysterectomy are no longer at risk for developing the disease Many past studies of uterine cancer incidence did not include such a correctionIncidence rates of uterine cancer have been rising and there have been previous reports of racial differences in incidence and survival rates with disparities observed for nonHispanic black women said Megan Clarke PhD lead author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow in NCIs Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics But few recent studies have corrected for hysterectomy which can vary by race and ethnicity and by region Correcting for hysterectomy prevalence gives us a more accurate picture of trends in overall incidence as well as rates by race and ethnicityThe study found that among all women hysterectomycorrected uterine cancer incidence rates overall increased by about 1 per year from 2003 to 2015 Incidence rates increased more rapidly among women of other racialethnic groups than among white women Uterine cancer incidence rates among black women surpassed those among white women in 2007 and were consistently higher from 2011 through 2015The researchers also looked separately at data on endometrioid and nonendometrioid subtypes of uterine cancer Compared with nonendometrioid subtypes endometrioid subtypes are more common generally have better prognoses and survival rates and have a stronger association with hormonal risk factors and obesity A novel approach to account for missing histology information was used to improve subtypespecific incidence estimatesIncidence rates of endometrioid subtypes were stable in nonHispanic white women over the study period and increased in women of other racialethnic groups By contrast incidence rates of aggressive nonendometrioid subtypes have been increasing dramatically over time in all racialethnic groups overall increase of 29 per year from 2000 to 2015 The researchers also observed much higher rates of the aggressive nonendometrioid subtypes in black women 259 per 100000 women over the study period than in white women 114 Hispanic women 101 and AsianPacific Islander women 75The researchers also found that the 5year relative survival rate was lower among all women with nonendometrioid subtypes than among women with endometrioid subtypes and that black women had the lowest survival rates within each stage at diagnosis or histologic subtypeAll of these trends  the rates of uterine cancer among black women exceeding those of white women the higher incidence rates of nonendometrioid subtypes among black women and the lower survival rates of black women for all uterine cancerare very concerning Dr Clarke said We need to continue research to further understand these racial differences and disparities in order to help us better predict risk and work toward preventionOne key message from this study is that these aggressive nonendometrioid cancers are increasing for all women Dr Clarke said She explained that because these cancers are much rarer than endometrioid subtypes less is known about them Important next steps include conducting research on the underlying causes of these subtypes to improve risk prediction and early detection of all uterine cancersThe increasing incidence of nonendometrioid subtypes is not likely explained by the rising prevalence of obesity and changes in use of hormone replacement therapy as these factors are more strongly associated with the endometrioid subtypes the rates of which remained more stable over the study period Dr Clarke explainedIf the increasing incidence rate was primarily related to obesity we wouldnt see stable trends for endometrioid subtypes among white women she said Obesity is the strongest risk factor associated with endometrioid subtypes However our study suggests that there are other factors leading to the increases in incidence of uterine cancer and this warrants further researchAbout the

Although popular news is abuzz with the latest chemical discovery as a potential pain reliever postsurgery this novel compound has a long way to go before emerging as a reliable alternative Resiniferatoxin RTX a molecule extracted from the narrowranging Euphorbia resinifera plant native to Morocco is currently under the spotlightWhile the potency of RTX is something researchers have been trumpeting about concerns regarding its effects have been largely drowned in the conversation The numbing effect of RTX is hugely powerful which might result in overly numbing the surgical site potentially masking any early signs of complications after the surgery Additionally while RTX shows promise in numbing the skin it doesnt act on internal organs Since surgeries often involve incisions beyond the skin layer there is a likelihood that opioids which proved to be stronger in managing postsurgery painwould still be needed for complete comfort Thus despite the hype the capability of RTX as a standalone pain reliever in the aftermath of a surgery is still in question The application of RTX also only provides temporary relief as the nerve endings for pain eventually grow back postsurgery Thus it serves as a bandaid solution rather than a complete alternative to opioids over an extended period Lastly there is an ongoing argument around the appropriateness of animal models as proxies for humans The results obtained from animal trials do not always translate to similar findings in human cases Therefore the success of RTX in animal models is not representative of its effectiveness in humans Despite the hype and initial positive results RTXs journey from an experimental treatment to a widespread clinical application is a long and uncertain one Huge challenges lie ahead not least the scramble for the scarce Euphorbia resinifera plant itself The plant native mostly to Morocco has already seen increasing demand due to the purported efficacy of its compounds With all these considerations in mind it seems clear that the road to a truly effective alternative to opioids remains long and arduous While RTX may play a role in this journey it is likely to be part of a wider solution rather than the standalone cure many hope it to be,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt4
A team of scientists from the National Institutes of Health has discovered biological mechanisms that appear to prevent damage to the heart muscles power grid the network of mitochondrial circuits that provide energy to cells One of those mechanisms the researchers found acts much like a circuit breaker allowing energy to continue moving throughout the heart muscle cells even when individual components of those cellsthe mitochondriahave been damagedThis discovery could have significant implications for understanding and treating diseases that affect the heart and skeletal muscles The researchers believe that these protective mechanisms could help shed light on how these muscles function under both healthy and unhealthy conditions such as heart disease mitochondrial diseases and muscular dystrophy The study published in Cell Reports was led by Brian Glancy PhD from the Muscle Energetics Laboratory of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute NHLBI which is part of NIHIn 2015 the same NIH research team announced the discovery of the mitochondrial power grid in skeletal muscle However questions remained about how this grid would protect itself from damage to the muscle cells The new findings offer insights into this protective mechanismUsing advanced imaging techniques and lightactivated probes the scientists observed a twopart system that safeguards the heart muscles power grid from diseaserelated damage Unlike the skeletal muscle where the mitochondrial circuits are organized as one large network the circuits in the heart are arranged in parallel rows forming smaller subnetworks These subnetworks act as a mechanism to limit the spread of electrical dysfunction to smaller regions thereby preventing extensive damageThe researchers likened the newly discovered circuit breaker mechanism to lightning striking a city power grid While lights may flicker over the whole city the circuit breaker activates to ensure that only a part of the city loses powerThis study received support from the NHLBI and the National Cancer Institute both part of NIHAbout the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute NHLBI NHLBI a part of the National Institutes of Health NIH conducts research on heart blood vessel lung and blood diseases as well as sleep disorders The institute also administers national health education campaigns on topics such as women and heart disease and healthy weight for children More information can be found on the NHLBI websiteAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH is the primary federal agency responsible for conducting and supporting medical research It consists of 27 Institutes and Centers and is part of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH investigates the causes treatments and cures for various diseases both common and rare For more information about NIH and its programs visit the NIH website,llm fake,2,VLPFN,QA_s

May 3 2023  What happens when a chatbot slips into your doctors direct messages Depending on who you ask it might improve outcomes On the other hand it might raise a few red flags The fallout from the COVID19 pandemic has been farreaching especially when it comes to the frustration over the inability to reach a doctor for an appointment let alone get answers to health questions And with the rise of telehealth and a substantial increase in electronic patient messages over the past 3 years inboxes are filling fast at the same time that doctor burnout is on the rise The old adage that timing is everything applies especially since technological advances in artificial intelligence or AI have been rapidly gaining speed over the past year The solution to overfilled inboxes and delayed responses may lie with the AIpowered ChatGPT which was shown to substantially improve the quality and tone of responses to patient questions according to study findings published in JAMA Internal Medicine There are millions of people out there who cant get answers to the questions that they have and so they post them on public social media forums like Reddit Ask Docs and hope that sometime somewhere an anonymous doctor will reply and give them the advice that they are looking for said John Ayers PhD lead study author and computational epidemiologist at the Qualcomm Institute at the University of CaliforniaSan Diego AIassisted messaging means that doctors spend less time worried about verb conjugation and more time worried about medicine he said rAskdocs vs Ask Your Doctor Ayers is referring to the Reddit subforum rAskdocs a platform devoted to providing patients with answers to their most pressing medical and health questions with guaranteed anonymity The forum has 450000 members and at least 1500 are actively online at any given time For the study he and his colleagues randomly selected 195 Reddit exchanges consisting of unique patient questions and doctor answers from last Octobers forums and then fed each full text question into a fresh chatbot session meaning that it was free of any prior questions that could bias the results The question doctor response and chatbot response were then stripped of any information that might indicate who or what was answering the question  and subsequently reviewed by a team of three licensed health care professionalsOur early study shows surprising results said Ayers pointing to findings that showed that health care professionals overwhelmingly preferred chatbotgenerated responses over the physician responses 4 to 1 The reasons for the preference were simple better quantity quality and empathy Not only were the chatbot responses significantly longer mean 211 words to 52 words than doctors but the proportion of doctor responses that were considered less than acceptable in quality was over 10fold higher than the chatbot which were mostly better than good And compared to doctors answers chatbot responses were more often rated significantly higher in terms of bedside manner resulting in a 98fold greater prevalence of empathetic or very empathetic ratings The past decade has demonstrated that there is a world of possibilities for AI applications from creating mundane virtual taskmasters like Apples Siri or Amazons Alexa to redressing inaccuracies in histories of past civilizations In health care AImachine learning models are being integrated into diagnosis and data analysis eg to speed up Xray computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging analysis or help researchers and clinicians collate and sift through reams of genetic and other types of data to learn more about the connections between diseases and fuel discovery The reason why this is a timely issue now is that the release of ChatGPT has made AI finally accessible for millions of physicians said Bertalan Mesk MD PhD director of The Medical Futurist Institute What we need now is not better technologies but preparing the health care workforce for using such technologies Mesk believes that an important role for AI lies in automating databased or repetitive tasks noting any technology that improves the doctorpatient relationship has a place in health care also highlighting the need for AI based solutions that improve their relationship by giving them more time and attention to dedicate to each other The how of integration will be key I think that there are definitely opportunities for AI to mitigate issues around physician burnout and give them more time with their patients said Kelly Michelson MD MPH director of the Center for Bioethics and Medical Humanities at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and attending physician at Ann  Robert H Lurie Childrens Hospital of Chicago But theres a lot of subtle nuances that clinicians consider when theyre interacting with patients that at least right now dont seem to be things that can be translated through algorithms and AIIf anything Michelson said that she would argue that at this stage AI needs to be an adjunct We need to think carefully about how we incorporate it and not just use it to take over one thing until its been better tested including message response she said Its really just a phase zero study And it shows that we should now move toward patientcentered studies using these technologies and not just willynilly flip the switch When it comes to the patient side of ChatGPT messaging several questions come to mind including relationships with their health care providers Patients want the ease of Google but the confidence that only their own provider may provide in answering said Annette Ticoras MD a boardcertified patient advocate serving the greater Columbus OH area The goal is to ensure that clinicians and patients are exchanging the highest quality informationThe messages to patients are only as good as the data that was utilized to give a response she said This is especially true with regard to bias AI tends to be kind of generated by existing data and so if there are biases in existing data those biases get perpetuated in the output developed by AI said Michelson referring to a concept called the black box The thing about the more complex AI is that oftentimes we cant discern whats driving it to make a particular decision she said You cant always figure out whether or not that decision is based on existing inequities in the data or some other underlying issue We need to be huge patient advocates and make sure that whenever and however AI is incorporated into health care that we do it in a thoughtful evidencebased way that doesnt take away from the essential human component that exists in medicine she said,real,0,VLPFN,0
NIHfunded study questions the effectiveness of personalized kidney screening for people with type 1 diabetesContrary to previous claims a new analysis performed by the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study group funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases NIDDK suggests that personalized kidney disease screening for people with type 1 diabetes T1D may not be as effective as previously thought The study published in Diabetes Care challenges the current recommendations for annual urinary albumin excretion rate AER testing for individuals with T1DThe study argues that there is insufficient evidence to support the notion that personalizing AER screening can lead to earlier detection of chronic kidney disease CKD The researchers found that the proposed screening intervals based on risk levels of CKD were not significantly associated with earlier CKD diagnoses Therefore the study questions the costeffectiveness and benefits of implementing a personalized approach to kidney disease screeningThis study challenges the widely accepted belief that people with T1D have a 50 risk of developing CKD over their lifetime The researchers argue that the risk may be overstated and that the current screening recommendations may be unnecessary for many individuals with T1D They suggest that annual screening for all individuals with T1D may not be justified based on the findings of their analysisThe study also raises concerns about the potential burden and costs associated with personalized kidney screening It argues that the proposed screening intervals could lead to unnecessary testing and increase healthcare costs without providing significant benefits in terms of early detection or improved outcomes for individuals with T1DThe findings of this study highlight the need for further research to better understand the effectiveness and costeffectiveness of personalized kidney screening for people with T1D It is crucial to critically evaluate the existing recommendations and consider alternative approaches that may be more beneficial for individuals with T1D in terms of reducing costs and improving outcomes,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_all
A recent study has raised concerns about a potential link between the frequent use of hair straighteners and uterine cancer The study found that women who used hair straighteners more than four times a year were 255 times more likely to be diagnosed with uterine cancer compared to those who never used these products However primary care doctors are unlikely to address this increased risk in their patients as they believe that the study does not provide enough evidence to prove causation The study also had limitations such as a small number of actual cases of uterine cancer and the lack of identification of specific brands of hair products used Despite these findings some experts recommend reducing the frequency of hair straightening to lessen the potential risk Additionally it is advised to use professional services and look for hair products free of harmful chemicals such as parabens and phthalates While the risk of uterine cancer is still relatively low women should be aware of the potential harm that these products may cause,llm fake,2,VLPFN,QA_s

Brains waste removal system may offer path to better outcomes in Alzheimers therapyNIHfunded study in mice suggests lymphatic boost could help reduce amyloid buildupEnhancing the brains lymphatic system when administering immunotherapies may lead to better clinical outcomes for Alzheimers disease patients according to a new study in mice Results published April 28 in Nature suggest that treatments such as the immunotherapies BAN2401 or aducanumab might be more effective when the brains lymphatic system can better drain the amyloidbeta protein that accumulates in the brains of those living with Alzheimers Major funding for the research was provided by the National Institute on Aging NIA part of the National Institutes of Health and all study data is now freely available to the broader scientific communityA broad range of research on immunotherapies in development to treat Alzheimers by targeting amyloidbeta has not to date demonstrated consistent results said NIA Director Richard J Hodes MD While this studys findings require further confirmation the link it has identified between a wellfunctioning lymphatic system in the brain and the ability to reduce amyloidbeta accumulation may be a significant step forward in pursuing this class of therapeuticsAbnormal buildup of amyloidbeta is one hallmark of Alzheimers disease The brains lymphatic drainage system which removes cellular debris and other waste plays an important part in that accumulation A 2018 NIAsupported study showed a link between impaired lymphatic vessels and increased amyloidbeta deposits in the brains of aging mice suggesting these vessels could play a role in agerelated cognitive decline and Alzheimers The lymphatic system is made up of vessels which run alongside blood vessels and which carry immune cells and waste to lymph nodes Lymphatic vessels extend into the brains meninges which are membranes that surround the brain and spinal cordFor this new study the research team sought to determine whether changing how well the lymphatic drainage works in the brain could affect the levels of amyloidbeta and the success of antibody treatments that target amyloidbeta Using a mouse model of earlyonset Alzheimers researchers removed some of the lymphatic vessels in the brains of one group of mice They treated these mice as well as a control group with injections of monoclonal antibody therapies including a mouse version of aducanumabMice with less functional lymphatic systems had greater buildup of amyloidbeta plaques and of other immune cells that cause inflammation which is another factor in Alzheimers pathology Moreover when the researchers compared immune cells in the brains of human Alzheimers patients with those of the mice whose meningeal lymphatic system had been diminished they found that the genetic fingerprints of certain immune cells in the brain the microglia were very similar between people with the disease and mice with defective lymphatic vessels These mice also performed more poorly on a test of learning and memory performance suggesting that dysfunctional lymphatic drainage in the brain contributes to cognitive impairment and increases difficulties for antibodies that target amyloidbetaThe researchers also assessed whether boosting the brains lymphatic system could reverse these changes They injected mice with amyloidbeta antibody therapies along with a growth factor that enhances the function of the brains meningeal lymph vessels The treated mice showed not only lower accumulations of amyloidbeta but also expansion of some parts of the lymphatic system in the brains meningesThese findings suggest that supporting the meningeal lymphatic system in people with Alzheimers  and starting treatment early in the disease when this system is more intact  could lead to better outcomes said Molly V Wagster PhD chief of the Behavioral  Systems Neuroscience Branch in NIAs Division of NeuroscienceThe research also shows that if lymphatics are removed the mouse microglia  trash collector cells in the brain  are much closer to those in humans and that the genes upregulated in microglia upon lymphatic dysfunction are linked to different aspects of Alzheimers pathology Writing for the research team Jonathan Kipnis PhD at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis notes in the paper that these data demonstrate that it may be possible to devise strategies to therapeutically target microglia and the brain blood vasculature which are both important in Alzheimers pathophysiology by modulating meningeal lymphatic vasculatureThe researchers suggest that future studies may help identify how well the brains lymphatic system is working as we age That could result in targeted treatments that could improve how well the lymphatic system drains amyloidbeta and other compounds in turn slowing the progression of AlzheimersThis was funded in part by NIH grants R37AG034113

Findings indicate cones precede rods as targets for infectionThe earliest eye damage from prion disease takes place in the cone photoreceptor cells specifically in the cilia and the ribbon synapses according to a new study of prion protein accumulation in the eye by National Institutes of Health scientists Prion diseases originate when normally harmless prion protein molecules become abnormal and gather in clusters and filaments in the human body and brainUnderstanding how prion diseases develop particularly in the eye because of its diagnostic accessibility to clinicians can help scientists identify ways to slow the spread of prion diseases The scientists say their findings published in the journal Acta Neuropathologica Communications may help inform research on human retinitis pigmentosa an inherited disease with similar photoreceptor degeneration leading to blindnessPrion diseases are slow degenerative and usually fatal diseases of the central nervous system that occur in people and some other mammals Prion diseases primarily involve the brain but also can affect the eyes and other organs Within the eye the main cells infected by prions are the lightdetecting photoreceptors known as cones and rods both located in the retinaIn their study the scientists from NIHs National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton Montana used laboratory mice infected with scrapie a prion disease common to sheep and goats Scrapie is closely related to human prion diseases such as variant familial and sporadic CreutzfeldtJakob disease CJD The most common form sporadic CJD affects an estimated one in one million people annually worldwide Other prion diseases include chronic wasting disease in deer elk and moose and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattleUsing confocal microscopy that can identify prion protein and various retinal proteins at the same time the scientists found the earliest deposits of aggregated prion protein in cone photoreceptors next to the cilia tubelike structures required for transporting molecules between cellular compartments Their work suggests that by interfering with transport through cilia these aggregates may provide an important early mechanism by which prion infection selectively destroys photoreceptors At a later study timepoint they observed similar findings in rodsPrion protein also was deposited in cones and rods adjacent to ribbon synapses just before the destruction of these structures and death of photoreceptors Ribbon synapses are specialized neuron connections found in ocular and auditory neural pathways and their health is critical to the function of retinal photoreceptors in the eye as well as hair cells in the earThe researchers say such detailed identification of diseaseassociated prion protein and the correlation with retinal damage has not been seen previously and is likely to occur in all prionsusceptible species including peopleNext the researchers are hoping to study whether similar findings occur in retinas of people with other degenerative diseases characterized by misfolded host proteins such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseasesJ Striebel et al Prioninduced photoreceptor degeneration begins with misfolded prion protein accumulation in cones at two distinct sites cilia and ribbon synapses Acta

Theres no one way to quit smoking but to quit you must be ready both emotionally and mentally You must also want to quit smoking for yourself not to please your friends or family It helps to plan ahead This guide will help you get started What Should I Do First Your first days of not smoking will be the hardest You should pick a date to quit smoking and then stick to it Write down your reasons for quitting before your quit day and read the list every day before and after you quit You should also come up with a quit plan It will help you stay focused and motivated Here are some ideas to get you started Write down when you smoke why you smoke and what you are doing when you smoke These are your smoking triggers You need to avoid these as often as possible going forward Stop smoking in certain situations such as during your work break or after dinner before actually quitting Make a list of activities you can do instead of smoking like taking a brisk walk or chewing a piece of gum You have to be ready to do something else when you want to smoke Ask your doctor about using nicotine replacement therapy gum or patches Some people find these helpful in curbing cravings Join a smoking cessation support group or program Call your local chapter of the American Lung Association to find groups near you Tell your friends and family about your quit smoking plan and let them know how they can support you Why Is Smoking So Addictive Blame nicotine the main drug in tobacco for your smoking addiction Your brain quickly adapts to it and craves more and more to feel the way you used to feel after smoking just one cigarette Over time your brain learns to predict when youre going to smoke a cigarette You feel down and tired so you think I need a cigarette and the cycle starts again But its not just about brain chemistry Certain situations make you want to smoke Everyones triggers are different Yours might include the smell of cigarette smoke seeing a carton of cigarettes at the store eating certain foods or drinking your morning coffee Sometimes just the way you feel sad or happy is a trigger One of the biggest keys to quitting smoking is spotting the triggers that make you crave smoking and trying to avoid themHow Hard Will It Be to Quit Everyone is different and how tough it will be for you depends on How many cigarettes you smoke daily If your friends and family members smoke Focus on the benefits Within hours of quitting your body starts to recover from the effects of nicotine and additives Your blood pressure heart rate and body temperature  all of which are higher than they should be because of the nicotine in cigarettes  return to healthier levels You can breathe easier Poisonous carbon monoxide in your blood drops so your blood can carry more oxygen No doubt about it Quitting helps your entire body It can even improve your looks Youll be less likely to get wrinkles when youre still young And youll save money too How Can I Avoid Smoking Again Slipping is a common part of quitting For most people trying to quit even just one puff counts And if you have just one it makes it that much harder to go completely smoke free But slipping does not mean you go back to smoking regularly Use your slip up to focus on your triggers and learn how to better deal with cravings And to avoid further slip ups and relapses try the following If you live with a smoker ask them not to smoke around you When you get the urge to smoke take a deep breath Hold it for 10 seconds and release it slowly Repeat this several times until the urge is gone Keep your hands busy Doodle play with a pencil or straw or work on a computer Change activities that were connected to smoking Take a walk or read a book instead of taking a cigarette break Hang out with nonsmokers or go to places that dont allow smoking such as the movies museums shops or libraries Exercise Exercising will help you relax Get support for quitting especially from family and friends Work with your doctor to develop a plan using overthecounter or prescription nicotine replacement aidsWhen you quit smoking you will have both physical and mental withdrawals You may crave cigarettes feel irritable and hungry cough often get headaches or have difficulty concentrating You have these symptoms of withdrawal because your body is used to nicotine When withdrawal symptoms occur within the first 2 weeks after quitting stay in control Think about your reasons for quitting Remind yourself that these are signs that your body is healing and getting used to being without nicotine The withdrawal symptoms are only temporary They are strongest when you first quit but will go away within 10 to 14 days Remember that withdrawal symptoms are easier to treat than the major diseases that smoking can cause You may still have the desire to smoke since there are many strong associations with smoking The best way to overcome these associations is to enjoy them without smoking If you relapse and smoke again dont lose hope Seventyfive percent of those who quit smoke again Most smokers quit 3 or more times before they are successful Plan ahead and think about what you will do the next time you get the urge to smoke,real,0,VLPFN,0

May 31 2022  After years going on and off medications for occasional asthma symptoms things went downhill for Brian Blome in November 2020 The retired carpenter started feeling short of breath and wheezing during bike rides At home he struggled with chores I was having a hard time climbing a flight of stairs just doing laundry says Blome who lives in the Chicago suburb of Palatine To get things under control he saw an allergist and started regular medications  two tablets two nasal sprays and inhaled corticosteroids each day plus an albuterol inhaler for flareups The inhalers have an extra feature an electronic monitor that attaches to the device and automatically tracks where and when the medication is used Bluetooth sends this information to an app on the patients mobile phone and to a dashboard where the medical team can see at a glance when symptoms are popping up and how regularly medications are taken  leading to the devices often being called smart inhalers At this years American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology AAAAI conference in Phoenix AZ researchers explained how digital monitoring devices can help diagnose and treat hardtocontrol asthma potentially reducing the need for oral steroids or biologic therapies Even though electric monitors have been on the market for years their use has been slow to catch on due to uncertainties around insurance coverage liability and how to manage and best use the data One recent study said these devices cost 100500 but that price depends on many things such as insurance About 17 of adult asthma patients have difficulttocontrol asthma meaning they limit their activity due to breathing symptoms and use reliever medications multiple times a week But research suggests that correcting inhaling technique and sticking to the use of the meds can cut that 17 down to just 37 says Blomes allergist Giselle Mosnaim MD of NorthShore University HealthSystem Mosnaim spoke about digital monitoring at a conference session on digital technologies for asthma management A study of more than 5000 asthma patients showed that if you have critical errors in inhaler technique this leads to worse asthma outcomes and increased asthma exacerbations she says It also shows that despite new devices and new technologies we still have poor inhaler techniqueYet adherence is poorly gauged by doctors and patient selfreporting The ideal measure of adherence should be objective accurate and unobtrusive to minimize impact on patient behavior and allow reliable data collection in realworld settings Mosnaim says So electronic medication monitors are the gold standard Patients not following instructions or guidelines is something we saw nonstop with kids says Caroline Moassessi founder of the allergy and asthma blog Gratefulfoodiecom who formerly served on a regional board of the American Lung Association Shes also the mother of two asthmatic children now in college who years ago used electronic medication monitors as part of a research trial They were unimpressed  mostly since I think they thought their asthma was controlled she says When patients are not in crisis they dont manage their asthma well Even in research studies such as the one Rachelle Ramsey PhD presented at the conference its not only hard to determine if better adherence leads to improved health but when For example does your adherence this week impact your asthma control this week or does it impact your asthma control next week Or is it even further out Do you need to have some level of adherence over the course of a month in order to have better outcomes at the end of that month says Ramsey a pediatric research psychologist at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center I think its a little complicated That said results from several small studies do show a connection between remote monitoring and better clinical outcomes One study enrolled asthma patients in the United Kingdom and another was done by Mosnaim with Chicagoarea patients In the UK quality improvement project nurses asked patients with difficulttocontrol asthma if they knew how to use their inhalers and were following treatment guidelines Those who said yes were invited to swap their steroidinhalers for a controller fitted with a device that tracks use and measures acoustics to test inhaler technique After 28 days of monitoring many people in the study had better clinical outcomesAnd after 3 months of digital monitoring patients didnt use their rescue medication quite as often Blome has seen a marked improvement in his asthma since starting regular appointments and getting back on daily medications a year and a half ago He says that now and then he has wheezing and shortness of breath usually while biking or exercising But those symptoms arent as severe or frequent as before From a doctors perspective digital inhaler systems allow me to discern patterns in order to determine what triggers his asthma symptoms and to adjust medications at different times of the year Mosnaim says Electronic systems can monitor pollen counts and air quality as well as how often a patient uses a quick reliever medication Thus she says tracking these measures yearround could raise attention to impending asthma attacks and suggest when to increase the dose of controller medications or add other treatments,real,0,VLPFN,0
New Discovery Reveals the Dangers of Opioid MedicationsA groundbreaking study funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse NIDA has uncovered alarming information about the effects of opioid medications used to treat pain Contrary to previous beliefs opioids such as morphine and oxycodone do not only act on surface receptors but also bind to receptors inside neurons This discovery raises serious concerns about the addictive nature of these drugsThe researchers found that medically used opioids bind to receptors that are not targeted by naturally occurring opioids This difference in binding mechanisms may explain the adverse effects and addictive properties of opioid medicines The studys authors suggest that the current opioids distort the normal activation and signaling of receptors leading to the unhealthy side effects of tolerance dependence and addictionThese findings highlight the urgent need for alternative methods of pain relief that do not produce addiction or other adverse effects The studys authors emphasize the importance of further research to better understand the potential dangers associated with opioid medications It is crucial to explore new avenues for designing pain relievers that are safe and effectiveThis groundbreaking research sheds light on the limitations and risks of current pain medications It is essential to prioritize the development of alternative treatments to avoid the harmful consequences of opioid use The National Institute on Drug Abuse NIDA and the National Institutes of Health NIH continue to support research in this area to improve the health and wellbeing of individuals suffering from pain,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt35
Boosting energy levels within damaged nerves may help them healNIHfunded project in mice provides insights into why nerves fail to regrow following injuryWhen the spinal cord is injured the damaged nerve fibers  called axons  are normally incapable of regrowth leading to permanent loss of function Considerable research has been done to find ways to promote the regeneration of axons following injury Results of a study performed in mice and published in Cell Metabolism suggests that increasing energy supply within these injured spinal cord nerves could help promote axon regrowth and restore some motor functions The study was a collaboration between the National Institutes of Health and the Indiana University School of Medicine in IndianapolisWe are the first to show that spinal cord injury results in an energy crisis that is intrinsically linked to the limited ability of damaged axons to regenerate said ZuHang Sheng PhD senior principal investigator at the NIHs National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS and a cosenior author of the studyLike gasoline for a car engine the cells of the body use a chemical compound called adenosine triphosphate ATP for fuel Much of this ATP is made by cellular power plants called mitochondria In spinal cord nerves mitochondria can be found along the axons When axons are injured the nearby mitochondria are often damaged as well impairing ATP production in injured nervesNerve repair requires a significant amount of energy said Dr Sheng Our hypothesis is that damage to mitochondria following injury severely limits the available ATP and this energy crisis is what prevents the regrowth and repair of injured axonsAdding to the problem is the fact that in adult nerves mitochondria are anchored in place within axons This forces damaged mitochondria to remain in place while making it difficult to replace them thus accelerating a local energy crisis in injured axonsThe Sheng lab one of the leading groups studying mitochondrial transport previously created genetic mice that lack the proteincalled Syntaphilinthat tethers mitochondria in axons In these knockout mice the mitochondria are free to move throughout axonsWe proposed that enhancing transport would help remove damaged mitochondria from injured axons and replenish undamaged ones to rescue the energy crisis said Dr ShengTo test whether this has an impact on spinal cord nerve regeneration the Sheng lab collaborated with XiaoMing Xu MD PhD and colleagues from the Indiana University School of Medicine who are experts in modeling multiple types of spinal cord injurySpinal cord injury is devastating affecting patients their families and our society said Dr Xu Although tremendous progress has been made in our scientific community no effective treatments are available There is definitely an urgent need for the development of new strategies for patients with spinal cord injuryWhen the researchers looked in three injury models in the spinal cord and brain they observed that Syntaphilin knockout mice had significantly more axon regrowth across the injury site compared to control animals The newly grown axons also made appropriate connections beyond the injury siteWhen the researchers looked at whether this regrowth led to functional recovery they saw some promising improvement in fine motor tasks in mouse forelimbs and fingers This suggested that increasing mitochondrial transport and thus the available energy to the injury site could be key to repairing damaged nerve fibersTo test the energy crisis model further mice were given creatine a bioenergetic compound that enhances the formation of ATP Both control and knockout mice that were fed creatine showed increased axon regrowth following injury compared to mice fed saline instead More robust nerve regrowth was seen in the knockout mice that got the creatineWe were very encouraged by these results said Dr Sheng The regeneration that we see in our knockout mice is very significant and these findings support our hypothesis that an energy deficiency is holding back the ability of both central and peripheral nervous systems to repair after injuryDr Sheng also points out that these findings while promising are limited by the need to genetically manipulate mice Mice that lack Syntaphilin show longterm effects on regeneration while creatine alone produces only modest regeneration Future research is required to develop therapeutic compounds that are more effective in entering the nervous system and increasing energy production for possible treatment of traumatic brain and spinal cord injuryThis study was supported by the NINDS Intramural Research Program ZIA NS003029 ZIA NS002946 NINDS NS100531 NS103481 US Department of Veterans Affairs Indiana

June 9 2022  The World Health Organization has warned of a strong likelihood that cases of monkeypox could escalate in Europe over the summer months with transmission of the virus boosted by people gathering at festivals and other largescale events The potential for further transmission in Europe and elsewhere over the summer is high Monkeypox has already spread against the backdrop of several mass gatherings in the region Hans Henri P Kluge the WHO regional director for Europe said last week Over the coming months many of the dozens of festivals and large parties planned provide further contexts where amplification may occur The UK has experienced the brunt in the current outbreak of monkeypox with a total of 321 cases confirmed by the UK Health Security Agency UKHSA as of June 7 the largest number of confirmed cases among 29 nations which have reported at least one case On Wednesday the Agency announced that it was making monkeypox a notifiable disease in England Globally there have been more than 1000 cases of the virus reported to the WHO in the current outbreak not including cases in African countries where the virus is endemic The risk of monkeypox becoming established in nonendemic countries is real WHO DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus PhD warned during a press briefing in Geneva on Wednesday That said Kluge in his May 31 statement said that based on the situation so far this outbreak is currently being transmitted through social networks connected largely through sexual activity primarily involving men who have sex with men Many of the infections appeared to involve fleeting andor multiple sexual partners sometimes associated with large events or parties he said though stressed that the monkeypox virus can affect anyone But the gay and bisexual communities should be applauded for their high awareness of health and willingness to contact healthcare services if they were symptomatic Kluge noted And despite the WHO clearly identifying festival season as a significant monkeypox infection risk he said it should also be seen as an opportunity to engage with young sexually active and globally mobile persons to raise awarenessThat is a stance that the UKHSA says it is taking to help contain the infection spreading here as the summer season begins The Agency told Medscape UK that it was working closely with a wide range of organizations nationally and regionally to boost awareness At first its campaign began in London on May 28 There was firm evidence to do so as epidemiological data up to May 30 showed that 86 of all monkeypox cases in England were in the capital By that date most cases had occurred in people aged 20 to 49 years old and 111 cases out of the 183 identified in England to that date identified themselves as gay bisexual or men who have sex with men To target those most at risk the UKHSA partnered with organizations including the LGBT website Stonewall and sexual health provider the Terence Higgins Trust to target audiences with public health messaging about the disease That was followed by a national rollout scheduled to last 4 weeks that has seen inapp advertising posted on the gay and bisexual dating platform Grindr alerting its users to the risk of contracting the monkeypox virus and directing them to reliable health information resources LGBT organisations and sexual health charities including the Terrence Higgins Trust Stonewall and Grindr have been superb at raising awareness of the symptoms and guiding people about what to do if they see a new rash or are concerned and wed like to thank them for all their efforts so far Andrew Lee the UKHSAs national incident director for monkeypox said Other campaigns have included working with Do It London to organize a 3week radio ad on Gaydio and an offer of support to Pride in the capital for sharing public health messaging The Agency says it is working with health protection bodies to coordinate activity with Londons sexual health stakeholders including developing a toolkit for event venues containing advice on cleaning protocols and vaccination for close contacts of monkeypox cases,real,0,VLPFN,0

Researchers question the effectiveness of potential male contraceptive identified in studyIn a recent mouse study conducted by researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health NIH a potential nonhormonal contraceptive for men has been identified However experts are questioning the effectiveness and viability of this contraceptive methodThe study involved giving male mice a compound called TDI11861 which temporarily disables a crucial enzyme for sperm cell activation This compound rendered the mouse sperm cells immobile and prevented them from maturing effectively inhibiting their ability to fertilize an egg While no pregnancies were observed in the mice experts argue that this might not necessarily translate to human malesCritics argue that the studys findings in mice may not accurately represent the effects of the compound on human males Mice and humans have significant physiological differences and what works in mice may not necessarily work in humans Furthermore the absence of observed side effects in the mice does not guarantee that the compound would be safe for human useDr Melanie Balbach who conducted the study acknowledges that further research is needed to determine the efficacy and safety of this potential male contraceptive in humans The study only provides proof of concept and does not guarantee the development of a safe and effective contraceptive for menThe researchers believe that their work could lead to the development of a safe ondemand nonhormonal and reversible oral contraceptive for men However many experts argue that more research is necessary to fully understand the potential risks and benefits of this contraceptive methodDr Christopher C Lindsey a program official in the NICHD Contraception Research Branch is available for comment on the study It is essential to gather opinions from various experts in the field to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the potential male contraceptive and its implicationsWhile this study represents a step forward in male contraceptive research it is crucial to approach the findings with caution Further research and clinical trials are necessary to determine the safety efficacy and longterm effects of this potential contraceptive method,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_all
NIHfunded project creates an encyclopedia detailing the inner workings of the human and mouse genomesENCODE Projects third phase offers new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genomeThe Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ENCODE Project is a worldwide effort to understand how the human genome functions With the completion of its latest phase the ENCODE Project has added millions of candidate DNA switches from the human and mouse genomes that appear to regulate when and where genes are turned on and a new registry that assigns a portion of these DNA switches to useful biological categories The project also offers new visualization tools to assist in the use of ENCODEs large datasetsThe projects latest results were published in Nature accompanied by 13 additional indepth studies published in other major journals ENCODE is funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute part of the National Institutes of HealthA major priority of ENCODE 3 was to develop means to share data from the thousands of ENCODE experiments with the broader research community to help expand our understanding of genome function said NHGRI Director Eric Green MD PhD ENCODE 3 search and visualization tools make these data accessible thereby advancing efforts in open scienceTo assess the potential functions of different DNA regions ENCODE researchers studied biochemical processes that are typically associated with the switches that regulate genes This biochemical approach is an efficient way to explore the entire genome rapidly and comprehensively This method helps to locate regions in the DNA that are candidate functional elements  DNA regions that are predicted to be functional elements based on these biochemical properties Candidates can then be tested in further experiments to identify and characterize their functional roles in gene regulationA key challenge in ENCODE is that different genes and functional regions are active in different cell types said Elise Feingold PhD scientific advisor for strategic implementation in the Division of Genome Sciences at NHGRI and a lead on ENCODE for the institute This means that we need to test a large and diverse number of biological samples to work towards a catalog of candidate functional elements in the genomeSignificant progress has been made in characterizing proteincoding genes which comprise less than 2 of the human genome Researchers know much less about the remaining 98 of the genome including how much and which parts of it perform other functions ENCODE is helping to fill in this significant knowledge gapThe human body is composed of trillions of cells with thousands of types of cells While all these cells share a common set of DNA instructions the diverse cell types eg heart lung and brain carry out distinct functions by using the information encoded in DNA differently The DNA regions that act as switches to turn genes on or off or tune the exact levels of gene activity help drive the formation of distinct cell types in the body and govern their functioning in health and diseaseDuring the recently completed third phase of ENCODE researchers performed nearly 6000 experiments  4834 in humans and 1158 in mice  to illuminate details of the genes and their potential regulators in their respective genomesENCODE 3 researchers studied developing embryonic mouse tissues to understand the timeline of various genomic and biochemical changes that occur during mouse development Mice due to their genomic and biological similarity to humans can help to inform our understanding of human biology and diseaseThese experiments in humans and mice were carried out in several biological contexts Researchers analyzed how chemical modifications of DNA proteins that bind to DNA and RNA a sister molecule to DNA interact to regulate genes Results from ENCODE 3 also help explain how variations in DNA sequences outside of proteincoding regions can influence the expression of genes even genes located far away from a specific variant itselfThe data generated in ENCODE 3 dramatically increase our understanding of the human genome said Brenton Graveley PhD professor and chair of the Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences at UCONN Health The project has added tremendous resolution and clarity for previous data types such as DNAbinding proteins and chromatin marks and new data types such as longrange DNA interactions and proteinRNA interactionsAs a new feature ENCODE 3 researchers created a resource detailing different kinds of DNA regions and their corresponding candidate functions A webbased tool called SCREEN allows users to visualize the data supporting these interpretationsThe ENCODE Project began in 2003 and is an extensive collaborative research effort involving groups across the US and internationally comprising over 500 scientists with diverse expertise It has benefited from and built upon decades of research on gene regulation performed by independent researchers around the world ENCODE researchers have created a community resource ensuring that the projects data is accessible to any researcher for their studies These efforts in open science have resulted in over 2000 publications from nonENCODE researchers who used data generated by the ENCODE ProjectThis demonstrates that the encyclopedia is widely used which is what we had always aimed for said Dr Feingold Many of these publications are related to human disease attesting to the resources value for relating basic biological knowledge to health researchNHGRI

March 6 2023  More than 80 of US adults with type 2 diabetes meet the criteria to use new treatment drugs such as semaglutide which is marketed as Ozempic according to a new study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine However only about 1 in 10 of those who meet the criteria used the drugs in recent years the study found In addition the high prices for some of the drugs means they may put them out of reach as the first drug treatment for these patients Most people with type 2 diabetes are prescribed metformin initially but generally have other medications added on but some of the newer drugs are now recommended as firstline treatment for some Its critical that we continue to study the best ways to manage type 2 diabetes including medications and lifestyle changes but its also important to examine how available these methods are to people says lead author Shichao Tang PhD a researcher with the Division of Diabetes Translation at the CDCs National Center for Chronic Disease PreventionThis includes researching how many people are using certain tools or medications and how many people are eligible for them which was the aim of this study Tang says A 2022 report from the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommended the use of certain drugs such as Ozempic which is given as a weekly injection with other similar drugs available as daily injections and oral tablets for patients with type 2 diabetes This is because as well as lowering blood sugar these new drugs have been found to reduce the risks of complications of diabetes such as heart disease and kidney disease and they also result in weight loss compared with older drugs The researchers estimated that for the 224 million US adults with diagnosed type 2 diabetes about 823 would meet the recommended criteria to use drugs from these two new classes About 945 of Medicare recipients with type 2 would be recommended to use them as well,real,0,VLPFN,0
June 21 2022  The rise of patient influencers has sparked concerns about the ethicality and transparency of their partnerships with pharmaceutical companies Recent findings published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research reveal a growing trend of pharmaceutical and medical companies partnering with influencers to market their products on platforms like Instagram and Twitter While these influencers may build niche followings and share their daytoday experiences the risks associated with their promotions should not be overlookedOne notable example is reality star Khloe Kardashian who appeared on The View to endorse the migraine drug Nurtec ODT as a paid spokesperson for Biohaven Pharmaceuticals However the FDA later sent Biohaven Pharmaceuticals a letter warning that Kardashians claims were false or misleading exposing the potential dangers of relying on patient influencers for medical adviceMoreover the lack of updated regulations for drug and medical companies advertising on social media poses a significant problem The guidelines established by the FDA and the FTC have not been updated since 2014 leaving newer social media features like Instagram or Facebook stories unregulated This raises the question of how the direct messages and temporary posts are being monitored and regulated putting consumers at risk of being misinformed or lacking necessary health literacyTransparency is a crucial aspect of patient influencers role but it is often lacking in their promotions It is essential for influencers to disclose their relationships and whether they receive compensation or free products for their endorsements The hesitancy and concern about these commercial partnerships are wellfounded as the industry primarily uses patient influencers as social capital rather than valuing their expertise regarding personal health experiencesWhile financial benefits may be attractive for patient influencers advertising prescription medications raises additional ethical considerations The high prices and limited accessibility of these medications further exacerbate the issue Patient influencers are not properly compensated for their marketing efforts due to existing regulations creating an imbalance in profitability compared to other influencers in different fieldsIt is important to note that patient influencers can use their platform to promote medical devices and share helpful resources However relying solely on patient influencers for medical advice carries risks Consumers should be cautious when coming across patient advocate posts and look out for keywords like ads or sponsored to maintain an objective perspective Ultimately consulting with a doctor before making any decisions regarding prescription drugs or medical devices is crucial for making informed choicesAs the prevalence of patient influencers continues to grow it is essential to address the ethical concerns and lack of regulation surrounding their promotions By being cautious and seeking advice from medical professionals individuals can navigate the world of healthcare more responsibly and ensure their wellbeing is not compromised by misleading endorsements,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_sem

Findings suggest drugs targeting immune cells may not be effective in treating deadly disease mainly affecting childrenResearchers at the National Institutes of Health found inconclusive evidence that specific immune cells may play a key role in the devastating effects of cerebral malaria a severe form of malaria that mainly affects young children The results published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation suggest that drugs targeting T cells may not be effective in treating the disease The study was supported by the NIH Intramural Research ProgramThis is the first study showing some indication that T cells may target blood vessels in brains of children with cerebral malaria said Dorian McGavern PhD chief of the Viral Immunology and Intravital Imaging Section at the NIHs National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS who codirected the study with Susan Pierce PhD chief of the Laboratory of Immunogenetics at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID These findings raise questions about the role of T cells in the development of disease pathology in children It is well established that T cells cause brain vasculature injury associated with cerebral malaria in mice but this correlation may not hold true in humansMore than 200 million people worldwide are infected annually with mosquitoborne parasites that cause malaria In a subset of those patients mainly young children the parasites accumulate in brain blood vessels causing cerebral malaria which leads to increased brain pressure from swelling Even with available treatment cerebral malaria still kills up to 25 of those affected resulting in nearly 400000 deaths annually Children who survive the infection will often have longlasting neurological problems such as cognitive impairmentThe researchers led by Drs Pierce and McGavern examined brain tissue from 23 children who died of cerebral malaria and 11 children who died from other causes The scientists used stateoftheart microscopy to explore the presence of cytotoxic lymphocytes CTLs in the brain tissue samples CTLs are a type of T cell in our immune system that is responsible for controlling infections throughout the bodyCurrent treatment strategies for cerebral malaria focus on red blood cells which are thought to clog blood vessels and create potentially fatal blockages leading to extreme pressure in the brain However findings in the mouse model demonstrated that CTLs damage blood vessels leading to brain swelling and death The role of CTLs in cerebral malaria in children hasnt been thoroughly investigated prior to this studyThe results of the current study demonstrate a potential increased accumulation of CTLs along the walls of brain blood vessels in the cerebral malaria tissue samples compared to noncerebral malaria cases However the significance of this observation is uncertain and it is unclear whether the CTLs actually play a critical role in cerebral malaria by damaging the walls of brain blood vesselsThe disease appears to potentially involve the presence of CTLs but further research is needed to confirm their role said Dr McGavernIn separate studies we discovered some preliminary evidence that treatment of mice with a drug that targets T cells may have rescued over 60 of otherwise fatal cases of experimental cerebral malaria said Dr Pierce However the effectiveness of this drug in treating cerebral malaria in humans remains uncertainThe impact of HIV coinfection on the risk of developing cerebral malaria is not known The NIH researchers compared CTL patterns in the cerebral malaria cases that were coinfected with HIV and those that were HIV negative In the HIVnegative cases the CTLs were seen lining up against the inside wall of brain blood vessels In the HIVpositive cases the CTLs had migrated across the surface to the outside of the vessels There were also potentially more CTLs present in the HIVpositive cases but the significance of this observation is unclearTogether these findings raise questions about the potential role of CTLs in cerebral malaria and the effectiveness of drugs targeting T cells Additional research is needed to uncover the role of T cells in human cerebral malaria Future studies will also investigate the effectiveness of targeting T cells in treating the disease Plans for a clinical trial are underway to test the effects of a specific T cell blocker in cerebral malaria patients in MalawiThe NINDS is the nations leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system The mission of NINDS is to seek

Oct 9 2022  The breast cancer death rate in the US dropped by 43 during the past three decades translating to 460000 fewer breast cancer deaths according to a new study from the American Cancer SocietyAt the same time Black women continue to be more likely to die from breast cancer even though they have a lower incidence of the diseaseDeath rates are declining in Black women just like they are in almost every other group but were still seeing the same gap Rebecca Siegel the senior study author and the senior scientific director of surveillance research at the American Cancer Society told CNNThe evidence is consistent that Black women receive short shrift in the health care system at every point of the breast cancer care continuum from lowerquality mammography to delays between the time of diagnosis and the beginning of treatment to poor quality treatment when they are diagnosed she said The takehome message is that we really need to take a hard look at how were treating Black women differently,real,0,VLPFN,0
THURSDAY March 9 2023 HealthDay News  Ongoing shortages of a medication that hospitals and emergency rooms rely upon to treat breathing problems are likely to worsen in coming days and weeks experts warn Thats because one of the two major US suppliers of liquid albuterol Akorn Pharmaceuticals abruptly laid off its entire workforce and closed plants in New Jersey New York and Illinois in late February Were down to just one plant thats supplying liquid albuterol to all patients in the United States said Dr Juanita Mora a Chicago allergistimmunologist and volunteer spokesperson for the American Lung Association That remaining supplier of liquid albuterol Nephron Pharmaceuticals has had manufacturing issues of its own exacerbating the situation even more said Bayli Larson a strategic initiatives associate with the American Society of HealthSystem Pharmacists ASHP Another phenomenon that could be at play is institutions anticipating the shortage may have increased their orders to ensure they had enough on hand Larson added ASHP discourages hoarding as a countermeasure to medication supply disruptions however some institutions feel they have to do it to avoid jeopardizing patient care The shortage comes at an extremely inopportune time Mora said We are about to enter allergic asthma season where pollen levels are going to begin to rise all throughout the United States Mora said And we know so many kids and adults suffer from allergic asthma symptoms and are already starting to see it now even here in Chicago because weve had such a mild winter I have a second asthmatic person of the day today coming in wheezing Albuterol acts upon the airways helping them dilate to improve breathing Its used for a variety of breathing disorders most commonly asthma and COPD Mora said Its used by 25 million asthmatics in the United States  that includes 20 million adults and 5 million kids  and 24 million people with COPD or emphysema plus anyone who suffers from any respiratory disease Mora said So this shortage is definitely concerning to the medical communityLiquid albuterol is typically used by emergency rooms to help people who are having a dire breathing problem The medication is administered from a nebulizer via a mouthpiece or face mask Some families with asthmatic children also use liquid albuterol in home nebulizers to help the kids breathe easier Mora said Shes already heard from parents who are unable to find liquid albuterol or refill it in pharmacies However albuterol inhalers are in stock and readily available Mora and Larson said Mora is recommending that all her patients have their albuterol inhaler up to date and current Usually each of the canisters has 200 doses That should carry them for a long time It works just as well as the albuterol liquid Mora said If people rely on inhalers at home that will help ease shortages among hospitals and emergency rooms Mora said Im telling people not to go ahead and try to fill liquid albuterol and hoard it Mora said Let the albuterol liquid thats currently available hit the hospitals and emergency departments where kids and adults are going in with asthma exacerbations or COPD exacerbations or emphysema But there are insurance problems with that approach said Dr Paul Williams presidentelect for the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology There are some populations that currently will probably suffer from not having liquid albuterol One is the Medicare population because currently liquid albuterol is covered under Medicare Part B whereas the metered dose inhalers are covered under Part D Williams said So patients have outofpocket expenses associated with inhalers I would often have patients who couldnt afford to buy their inhalers but would do OK with the nebulizer Its also more difficult to use inhalers to treat infants and disabled people with breathing problems Williams said But I think if we limit the use of liquid albuterol to populations that really need it that shortage can be mitigated to some degree Williams added The trouble began last May when Nephron which makes generics issued a voluntary nationwide recall of 21 million doses of various medications according to the US Food and Drug Administration The company cited sterility issues as a reason for the recall,real,0,VLPFN,0

Clinical trial of investigational Ebola treatments begins in the Democratic Republic of the CongoAn international research team has begun patient enrollment in a clinical trial testing multiple investigational Ebola therapies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC The randomized controlled trial is enrolling patients of any age with confirmed Ebola virus disease EVD at a treatment unit in the city of Beni operated by ALIMA The Alliance for International Medical Action a medical humanitarian organizationThe trial which will expand to additional DRC districts is organized through an international research consortium coordinated by the World Health Organization WHO It is led and funded by the National Institute for Biomedical Research INRB part of the DRC Ministry of Health and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of the US National Institutes of Health and also involves several additional international partnersCombatting Ebola requires a comprehensive response that draws on the strengths of all areas of public health Biomedical research can lead to critical new tools such as potentially lifesaving therapies said NIAID Director Anthony S Fauci MD Through scientifically and ethically sound clinical trials we hope to efficiently and definitively establish the safety and efficacy of these investigational Ebola treatments offering new ways to save livesOn Aug 1 2018 the DRC Ministry of Health declared the countrys 10th outbreak of EVD As of Nov 25 2018 240 deaths out of 419 confirmed and probable cases of EVD have been reported in the northeastern provinces of North Kivu and Ituri Under the leadership of the DRC Ministry of Health the WHO has coordinated the outbreak response with several international partners NIAID along with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the US Agency for International Development USAID and other US government partners have provided guidance and support to the multisectoral outbreak responseWe urgently need a safe and effective treatment for this deadly disease said DRC Minister of Health Oly Ilunga Kalenga MD PhD As we face a 10th outbreak of Ebola we hope this clinical trial will give us more information about how best to treat patientsThe trial aims to compare mortality among patients who receive one of three investigational Ebola drugs with a control group of patients who receive the investigational monoclonal antibody cocktail treatment ZMapp developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc The therapies being tested include mAb114 a single monoclonal antibody developed by NIAID with early support from the INRB and remdesivir also known as GS5734 an antiviral drug developed by Gilead Sciences Inc The trial has been approved to begin enrolling patients in these three groups and plans are underway to amend the trial to include REGNEB3 also known as REGN347034713479 a monoclonal antibody cocktail developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals IncThe participating Ebola treatment units will continue to provide all participants with supportive care for EVD Ebola care includes supportive oral andor intravenous fluids electrolyte replacement maintaining oxygen status and blood pressure and pain managementThe investigational treatments have varying levels of data to support their use from testing in the laboratory animals and humans However none has been approved for treating EVD ZMapp is the only investigational treatment previously tested in a randomized controlled efficacy trial Results from that study conducted in the US and West Africa during the 2014 to 2016 outbreak suggested that ZMapp appeared to be beneficial but as the outbreak waned the trial ultimately could not enroll enough participants to definitively establish the drugs efficacyThe investigational treatments also have been administered to most of the Ebola patients in the current outbreak in the DRC under an ethical framework developed by the WHO called Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions MEURI However this emergencyuse mechanism cannot yield generalizable evidence on how well the treatments workA randomized controlled clinical trial is necessary to obtain reliable data about the safety and efficacy of investigational Ebola treatments said H Clifford Lane MD director of NIAIDs Division of Clinical Research It is possible to conduct rigorous clinical research in an outbreak setting and we anticipate this trial will provide useful dataProfessor JeanJacques MuyembeTamfum MD PhD directorgeneral of the INRB and Richard T Davey Jr MD deputy director of NIAIDs Division of Clinical Research are coprincipal investigators for the studyTrial participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of the investigational treatments by intravenous infusion Site clinicians will monitor patients symptoms and take blood samples for laboratory tests Patients will remain in the Ebola treatment unit until they fully recover from the disease They will be asked to return to the clinic approximately two months after receiving treatment for a checkup and to provide additional blood samples for laboratory testsPlans are underway to expand the trial beyond the ALIMA site in Beni to additional Ebola treatment units operated by medical humanitarian organizations including International Medical Corps The trial also may be adapted to continue across more than one outbreak and in several countries The number of participants enrolled in the trial ultimately will depend on the evolution of Ebola outbreaks The study is designed to enroll 112 patients per arm potentially over multiple outbreaksThis clinical trial marks a significant and important step forward for the DRC and our international partners said Dr Muyembe We are eager to learn more about each of these investigational treatments as we continue to work tirelessly to identify new cases trace contacts and control the spread of diseaseAn independent data and

July 22 2022  President Joe Bidens battle with COVID19 serves as a stark reminder that the threat to the elderly persists Despite the availability of vaccines older Americans remain more vulnerable to severe illness and death from the virus compared to other age groups In a concerning development COVID deaths have seen a marked increase among older Americans this year surpassing any other period since the widespread availability of vaccinesThe worrying trend is amplified when considering the low uptake of booster shots among older Americans Despite campaigns encouraging individuals over 50 to receive their second booster the response has been disappointing Shockingly only 365 of Americans over 65 have received a second booster leaving them susceptible to the new and highly evasive BA4 and BA5 subvariantsThese subvariants pose a significant risk as they appear to bypass the bodys immune defense systems making them more dangerous than previously thought This alarming development calls for urgent action with health officials stressing the need for older individuals to prioritize securing their booster shotsWhile it is true that older people generally have weaker immune systems and more health conditions the devastating impact of COVID on senior Americans cannot be solely attributed to these factors Nursing homes particularly during the early days of the pandemic have witnessed a distressing number of infections and deaths It begs the question Are these facilities adequately equipped to care for our elderly populationIt is imperative that we address these urgent concerns and ensure that the most vulnerable among us are protected from this relentless virus The risks faced by older Americans should serve as a rallying cry for improved vaccination efforts and better care provisions for our elderly population Only through decisive action and collective responsibility can we bring an end to this crisis,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_sem

THURSDAY Feb 23 2023 HealthDay News  All those images of beautifullooking people on social media can deflate a young persons selfimage but there may be an easy fix limiting time spent on TikTok Instagram and the like A new Canadian study finds that teens and young adults who already had symptoms of anxiety or depression and who cut their social media usage by about 50 experienced a significant improvement in how they felt about their overall appearance in just a few weeks They also felt better about their weight I dont think it completely surprised me said study coauthor Helen Thai a PhD student in the psychology department at McGill University in Montreal Past research on traditional media and the impact of unattainable beauty and body ideals has obtained similar results Thai suggested Not only are there celebrities and influencers on there but its also people within your social circle Thai said about social media which can make comparison a bit more easy The authors estimated that youth spend about six to eight hours each day on screens A lot of that time is spent on social media sites where they may see hundreds or thousands of images internalizing them In a news release about the study lead author Gary Goldfield a senior scientist with the Childrens Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute said that whether people who already have body and mental health issues simply spend more time on social media or whether social media leads to greater issues had not been known For this study the researchers worked with 220 undergraduate students ages 17 to 25 About 76 were women 23 men and 1 other Participants needed to regularly use social media for at least two hours each day on their smartphones I think before asking the why we wanted to ask who would be most vulnerable to it and so thats specifically why we targeted youth who are at risk of body image concerns Thai said These were students who had symptoms of anxiety and depressionEach was asked to respond to statements about their appearance such as Im pretty happy about the way I look or I am satisfied with my weight on a 5point scale at the start and end of the experiment Especially if youre feeling vulnerable and you dont think that great about yourself seeing all these people who look in your eyes more beautiful than you or more whatever is just going to make you feel worse and worse said study coauthor Chris Davis a professor in the psychology department at Carleton University in Ottawa During the first week all participants were asked to use social media as they typically would A screentime tracking program measured their usage After that half were asked to use social media for no more than 60 minutes a day The participants who were asked to restrict their social media usage got it down to 78 minutes a day on average The control group averaged 188 minutes daily After three weeks those who reduced their social media usage had a significant improvement in how they regarded their overall appearance and body weight after the intervention compared with the control group which saw no significant change the researchers said Nancy Mramor a psychologist in Pittsburgh said that when you compare yourself to others youll have a 5050 chance of feeling bad about yourself Mramor was not involved in this study In everything she said its important to compare yourself only to yourself Thats true of social media sports performance academics or social standing she said For example dont compare your weight to that of someone you see online but instead to what it was like for you last week Focusing on your inner feeling about yourself rather than outside images creates an opportunity to see yourself from the inside out not just the outside When images are not fed to you on your phone you have a breather to notice what is important to you Mramor said For minors the best way to limit social media is with extreme parental supervision Mramor said Block the sites on their phones that you think will be harmful,real,0,VLPFN,0

By Peter A McCullough MD MPHFar and away the most common question I get from those who took one of the COVID19 vaccines is how do I get this out of my body The mRNA and adenoviral DNA products were rolled out with no idea on how or when the body would ever breakdown the genetic code The synthetic mRNA carried on lipid nanoparticles appears to be resistant to breakdown by human ribonucleases by design so the product would be longlasting and produce the protein product of interest for a considerable time period This would be an advantage for a normal human protein being replaced in a rare genetic deficiency state eg alpha galactosidase in Fabrys disease However it is a big problem when the protein is the pathogenic SARSCoV2 Spike The adenoviral DNA Janssen should broken down by deoxyribonuclease however this has not be exhaustively studiedThis leaves dissolution of Spike protein as a therapeutic goal for the vaccine injured With the respiratory infection Spike is processed and activated by cellular proteases including transmembrane serine protein 2 TMPRSS2 cathepsin and furin With vaccination these systems may be avoided by systemic administration and production of Spike protein within cells As a result the pathogenesis of vaccine injury syndromes is believed to be driven by accumulation of Spike protein in cells tissues and organsNattokinase is an enzyme is produced by fermenting soybeans with bacteria Bacillus subtilis var natto and has been available as an oral supplement It degrades fibrinogen factor VII cytokines and factor VIII and has been studied for its cardiovascular benefits Out of all the available therapies I have used in my practice and among all the proposed detoxification agents I believe nattokinase and related peptides hold the greatest promise for patients at this timeTanikawa et al examined the effect of nattokinase on the Spike protein of SARSCoV2 In the first experiment they demonstrated that Spike was degraded in a time and dose dependent manner in a cell lysate preparation that could be analogous to a vaccine recipient The second experiment demonstrated that nattokinase degraded the Spike protein in SARSCoV2 infected cells This reproduced a similar study done by Oba and colleagues in 2021Tanikawa T Kiba Y Yu J Hsu K Chen S Ishii A Yokogawa T Suzuki R Inoue Y Kitamura M Degradative Effect of Nattokinase on

purity Kurosawa and colleagues have shown in humans that after a single oral dose of 2000 FU Ddimer concentrations at 6 and 8 hours and blood fibrinfibrinogen degradation products at 4 hours after administration elevated significantly p  005 respectively Thus an empiric starting dose could be 2000 FU twice a day Full pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have not been completed but several years of market use as an overthecounter supplement suggests nattokinase is safe with the main caveat being excessive bleeding and cautions with concurrent antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugsBased on these findings nattokinase and similar products such as serrapeptase should undergo wellfunded accelerated preclinical and clinical development programs The issue at hand is the urgency of time similar to that with SARSCoV2 infection and empiric early therapy It will take up to 20 years to have a fully developed pharmaceutical profile to characterize the safety and efficacy of nattokinase in the treatment of vaccine injury and postCOVID syndromes Large number of people are sick now and many believe empiric treatment is justified given sufficiently low risk of side effects and potentially high reward My recommendation is to discuss this with your doctor or seek a specialist in holistic or naturopathic medicine who is experienced with the safety profile of nattokinase in

Dec 13 2022  A new report from the Commonwealth Fund and Yale School of Public Health reveals that COVID19 vaccinations have only prevented 100000 deaths and 500000 hospitalizations in the United States The report developed from computer modeling claims that the cost of these vaccines has burdened the US health system with no significant savings Without vaccination there would have been only a small increase in COVID19 infections the authors write Despite administering over 655 million doses and having 80 of the population vaccinated the report suggests that the vaccines have not made a significant impact Since December 2020 the US has reported millions of COVID19 cases hospitalizations and deaths indicating that the vaccines are not as effective as claimed The research took into account various variants of the virus including Iota Alpha Gamma Delta and Omicron raising concerns about their effectiveness This report highlights the limited success of vaccines in saving lives says Syra Madad DHSc senior director of the Systemwide Special Pathogens Program at NYC Health and Hospitals She explains that the economic benefits of vaccination are overshadowed by job losses and other negative impacts The New York report last month questioned the return on investment of the vaccine suggesting that the costs outweigh the benefits Timothy Brewer MD a professor of medicine and epidemiology at UCLA also raises doubts about the reliability of these estimates as they fail to consider breakthrough infections Coauthor Alison Galvani PhD founding director of the Yale Center for Infectious Disease Modeling and Analysis admits that the model used in the study may underestimate the total benefit of vaccination Nevertheless the report suggests that countries struggling with vaccine coverage should reconsider their efforts William Schaffner MD an infectious disease expert claims that the numbers presented in the report are not as impressive as they seem questioning the effectiveness of the vaccines He suggests that the American people have been misled into investing in vaccines that have not delivered the promised results,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_sem
July 12 2022  While most people are familiar with facial recognition as a means to unlock their smartphones a new study suggests that this technology has the potential to be used in the fight against cancer Researchers from University College London and the University of California San Diego have developed an innovative algorithm that bears resemblance to facial recognition except instead of identifying faces it can identify cancer mutations in DNAThese mutations known as copy number changes have been found to be associated with different outcomes in patients with the same type of cancer Until now there has been a lack of tools to interpret these changes accurately However this algorithm created by Dr Nischalan Pillay of University College London has the ability to translate the changes into valuable information that doctors could use to predict the behavior of a particular cancerThrough this breakthrough technology doctors may have the potential to provide more accurate outlooks for patients as well as develop more effective treatment strategies The ability to identify and understand these cancer mutations could potentially save lives by allowing for personalized and targeted treatments This study represents a significant step forward in the fight against cancer opening up numerous possibilities for advancements in cancer care,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_role
New Orleanians who fled their homes ahead of Hurricane Idas terrifying wrath and later tried to return to salvage keepsakes and mementoes met unwelcome visitors along the treacherous stretch of road highway 610 just south of Lake PontchartrainAt an intersection due east of Metairie sat four amphibious vehicles with FEMA logos stenciled on either side of the carriage Beside the vehicles armed FEMA agents peered through binoculars watching for persons braving the deluge Next to them two CDC personnel handled a cooler brimming with Covid19 vaccinationsDennis Farrell a New Orleans native and his son Chris had been traversing the perilous stretch of road when he spotted the curious roadblock ahead of his GMC Yukon He knew that Louisianas Governor John Bell Edwards had ordered evacuees to avoid the city at all costs citing flooding downed power lines scorching heat lack of potable water and potential death as his gravest concernsBut at the hotel where Mr Farrell had been staying he had heard other Ida refugees discussing ignoring the governors mandate because roving bands of looters reportedly had been pillaging the city and plundering washedout homes and businessesMr Farrell was concerned because he had left behind a locked gun cabinet and his wifes jewelry box and he sought to recover those items before they fell into criminal hands So early Tuesday morning he and his son took to the road in hopes of recovering the valuablesuntil FEMA stopped them in their tracksFEMA Mr Farrell told Real Raw News intercepted his Yukon and demanded he and his son exit the vehicleThey werent concerned for our safety or anything Those guys had their hands on their rifles while the CDC folks hung behind them First thing they asked me was if me and Chris had gotten the Covid19 shot and if so to show them our vaccination cards Mr Farrell saidWhen Mr Farrell admitted neither he nor his son had gotten a vaccination the FEMA agents became combative and belligerent and admonished them for putting their friends and family at risk by not taking the shot like patriotic Americans do Mr Farrell told FEMA he didnt trust the vaccine citing rushed development and safety an efficacy concerns and that his family was in excellent health with no comorbidities and at little risk of dying from a virus with a 996 survival rateThey told me my stupidity was a comorbidity Mr Farrell saidThe agents Mr Farrell added had great news for him fortunately they had a cooler full of Covid19 vaccinations and CDC medical technicians on hand to administer those vaccinationsThey told me there was a massive Delta outbreak going around New Orleans and they werent letting people back without proof of the shot or getting the shot right then and there When I told them I didnt want my property looted they told me if my valuables got stolen itd be a small price to pay compared to the damage I might cause by spreading Covid around the community They said if I wanted to pass I had to take their shot If I didnt Id have to turn around Mr Farrell saidMr Farrell refused the vaccination and told FEMA that mandatory vaccinations violated his Godgiven and Constitutional rights Rather than push the issue and risk an engagement with maniacal armed federal officials he swung his in the opposite direction and headed back to the hotelWed rather loose our stuff to looters than be slaves to the government he told RRNIn closing Mr Farrell said he had spoken via phone to neighbors who had similar encounters with FEMA RRN has not yet independently verified additional claimsGates Update ASAPVisited 13264 times 13264 visits today,human fake,1,VLPFN,0
Dec 14 2022  Forget about counting calories People with type 2 diabetes can lose weight and keep their blood sugar under control by eating a lowcarb high fat dietThis is according to a new study that found this type of diet did more to help patients with type 2 diabetes than a highcarbohydrate lowfat diet And this was true no matter how many calories the person ateThese findings were based on a randomized controlled trial and the results were published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine this weekThe trial looked at 185 patients with type 2 diabetes for whom lowcalorie diets are often recommended to help people lose weight and improve glycemic control a medical term referring to the typical levels of sugar in a persons bloodThe trouble with this common recommendation the investigators wrote is that it often leads to hunger so few patients stick to itTherefore calorieunrestricted diets may be a better alternative to achieve longterm maintenance wrote study author Camilla Dalby Hansen MD of the University of Southern Denmark and colleagues,real,0,VLPFN,0

Aug 11 2022  It might be a good time to stock up on home COVID19 tests Today the FDA issued new guidance on athome COVID testing It still recommends repeat testing after a negative result but is also recommending that people who have no symptoms but think they have been exposed take three tests instead of two If a first or repeat test is positive follow the CDC guidance on isolation and get medical care If the first test is negative and you have symptoms test again 48 hours later You may choose to test yet again 48 hours after the second test and may also consider getting a laboratory molecularbased PCR test and seeking medical care If the first test is negative you dont have symptoms but you believe you have been exposed test again 48 hours later then 48 hours after the second negative for a total of at least three tests After three negative tests if you are concerned the FDA suggests testing again at home getting a PCR test or getting medical advice Current guidelines from the CDC recommend testing at home right away if you get symptoms If you have been exposed to COVID19 it recommends testing at least 5 days after exposure  and if that test is negative it says to consider testing again 12 days later The new guidance from the FDA is based on findings from a new study by University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School researchers showed the new timelines are more likely to detect an infection Researchers evaluated 5609 people who are enrolled in the national Test Us At Home study from October 2021 to January The participants used one of three retail test kits and also collected a sample for a molecular PCR test They tested every 48 hours for 15 days During the study period 154 people tested positive for the coronavirus that causes COVID19 based on the PCR samples After testing twice at home over 48 hours more than 90 of infections were detected in symptomatic people who began testing within the first weekSerial testing three times with an athome test at 48hour intervals detected more than 75 of infections an increase from about 60 after testing just twice The study is published as a preprint and is not yet peerreviewed Bottom line from the study Athome antigen tests are more likely to detect COVID19 within the first week of infection if a person who doesnt have symptoms tests three times with 48 hours in between each test and people with symptoms test twice with the one 48hour interval Antigen tests work as long as people use them as indicated says Apurv Soni MD an assistant professor of medicine at UMass and the studys principal investigator The problem is the research on how to use home tests has been squishy His team set out to find out how well the home tests could detect SARSCoV2 the virus that causes COVID19 for people with and without symptoms The analysis included only people who had no symptoms and tested negative by both athome antigen and PCR tests on the first day of the study The home tests used in the study were Quidels QuickVUE AtHome Abbotts BinaxNOW and Becton Dickinson and Companys BD Veritor For those with symptoms who tested negative twice those two tests found about 94 of the infections Soni says But if you are asymptomatic you have to do three tests 48 hours apart to capture 79 of the infections The FDAs new safety communication is based on the study finding that when those without symptoms test just twice many infections go undiscovered making it easy to spread the infection to others Those without symptoms may simply not have enough virus in their body to get a positive test at first says Carly Herbert an MDPhD candidate at UMass Chan Medical School one of the study coauthors The rapid antigen test is very correlated with viral load That may be why it takes that long The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics Tech programTranslating advice about when and how to do home tests to realworld situations isnt simple Soni says especially for those who dont have symptoms If someone goes to a party and then has symptoms they could start testing then and repeat the test twice he says If both are negative theres a 94 chance they dont have COVID according to the UMass study If you dont have symptoms do three tests 48 hours apart sometime after you find out you were exposed Soni says acknowledging that the notification time varies His team is reviewing data from their research on those details as well as ideal timelines and hopes to have more information soon he says The study looked at a question that needs addressing says William Schaffner MD a professor of preventive medicine and infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center A lot of people see that one negative test as a Get out of jail free card What the researchers have found is that with the development of time you are more likely to test positive he says Biological differences between COVID19 variants may explain differences in testing and failure to pick up an infection on the first test says Wilbur Lam MD PhD a professor at Emory University and the Georgia Institute of Technology The rapid tests compared to traditional PCR tests seem to be less sensitive with false negatives especially in the first few days of infection Testing serially improves that sensitivity he says The study findings are not surprising says Amesh Adalja MD a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore Serial testing with an antigen test especially in asymptomatic individuals will be more likely to pick up cases he says For those who dont have symptoms the test results give valuable information about whether they will be infectious to others The study data is solid Schaffner says But with advice to test more public officials are going to have to supply more tests if they hope people will comply he says Will people follow the new advice There will be a segment of the population that will follow this closely Schaffner says But the large majority of the people are not going to be interested in repeated testing Even so the study results make good sense he says,real,0,VLPFN,0
NIH researchers claim to have used genomics to differentiate squamous cell carcinomas SCCs from other cancers but their findings are questionable and may not actually advance treatments for head and neck and other cancers The study led by Carter Van Waes MD PhD and his colleague Zhong Chen MD PhD from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders NIDCD has found molecular characteristics that allegedly link the genomic profiles of SCCs from five areas of the body However their research methods and dataset are not robust enough to draw accurate conclusionsThe researchers claim to have used a dataset of SCCs from the head and neck lung esophagus cervix and bladder to uncover defining characteristics in subtypes of SCCs associated with tobacco use or human papillomavirus HPV infection But the question remains as to whether these characteristics are truly unique to SCCs and whether they can be used to develop tailored strategies for specific cancer subtypes The study has been published in Cell Reports but the validity of the research and its potential to improve diagnosis and treatment of these cancers is highly questionableThe study is part of the larger PanCancer Atlas project which consists of 27 papers published in Cell journals This project claims to contain molecular and clinical information on more than 10000 tumors from 33 forms of cancer However the accuracy and reliability of the PanCancer Atlas dataset has not been thoroughly reviewed or scrutinized by the scientific community Without proper validation the findings and insights derived from this project cannot be considered reliable or trustworthyFurthermore the researchers themselves admit that their study expands upon previous research that compared genomic features of SCCs in head and neck cancer associated with smoking or HPV This raises concerns about the originality and significance of their findings It is unclear how much new information this study actually brings to the field and whether it is truly advancing our understanding of these cancersThe researchers claim to have found similarities in the genomic characteristics of head and neck cancers with lung cancers bladder cancers and cervical cancer However without a comprehensive understanding of the genomic landscape of these different cancers it is difficult to draw accurate comparisons and determine the true significance of these similarities The researchers may be overreaching in their conclusions and overstating the potential implications of their findingsOverall while the NIHfunded researchers claim to have made significant advancements in the understanding of SCCs their study falls short in terms of reliability and scientific rigor The validity of their dataset and the accuracy of their findings are questionable Without further validation and independent confirmation it is premature to suggest that this research will lead to more effective diagnosis and treatment of these cancers,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_all

NIH study finds Black women may be more affected due to higher useWomen who used chemical hair straightening products were at higher risk for uterine cancer compared to women who did not report using these products according to a new study from the National Institutes of Health The researchers found no associations with uterine cancer for other hair products that the women reported using including hair dyes bleach highlights or permsThe study data includes 33497 US women ages 3574 participating in the Sister Study a study led by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences NIEHS part of NIH that seeks to identify risk factors for breast cancer and other health conditions The women were followed for almost 11 years and during that time 378 uterine cancer cases were diagnosedThe researchers found that women who reported frequent use of hair straightening products defined as more than four times in the previous year were more than twice as likely to go on to develop uterine cancer compared to those who did not use the productsWe estimated that 164 of women who never used hair straighteners would go on to develop uterine cancer by the age of 70 but for frequent users that risk goes up to 405 said Alexandra White PhD head of the NIEHS Environment and Cancer Epidemiology group and lead author on the new study This doubling rate is concerning However it is important to put this information into context  uterine cancer is a relatively rare type of cancerUterine cancer accounts for about 3 of all new cancer cases but is the most common cancer of the female reproductive system with 65950 estimated new cases in 2022 Studies show that incidence rates of uterine cancer have been rising in the United States particularly among Black womenApproximately 60 of the participants who reported using straighteners in the previous year were selfidentified Black women according to the study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute Although the study did not find that the relationship between straightener use and uterine cancer incidence was different by race the adverse health effects may be greater for Black women due to higher prevalence of useBecause Black women use hair straightening or relaxer products more frequently and tend to initiate use at earlier ages than other races and ethnicities these findings may be even more relevant for them said CheJung Chang PhD an author on the new study and a research fellow in the NIEHS Epidemiology BranchThe findings are consistent with prior studies showing straighteners can increase the risk of hormonerelated cancers in womenThe researchers did not collect information on brands or ingredients in the hair products the women used However in the paper they note that several chemicals that have been found in straighteners such as parabens bisphenol A metals and formaldehyde could be contributing to the increased uterine cancer risk observed Chemical exposure from hair product use especially straighteners could be more concerning than other personal care products due to increased absorption through the scalp which may be exacerbated by burns and lesions caused by straightenersTo our knowledge this is the first epidemiologic study that examined the relationship between straightener use and uterine cancer said White More research is needed to confirm these findings in different populations to determine if hair products contribute to health disparities in uterine cancer and to identify the specific chemicals that may be increasing the risk of cancers in womenThis team previously found that permanent hair dye and straighteners may increase breast and ovarian cancer riskAbout the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences NIEHS NIEHS supports research to understand the effects of the environment on human health and is part of the National Institutes of Health For more information on NIEHS or environmental health topics visit httpswwwniehsnihgov or subscribe to a news listAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,real,0,VLPFN,0
Fecal microbiota transplants have emerged as a potential breakthrough in the treatment of cancers that do not respond to immunotherapy drugs according to a new study Researchers at the National Cancer Institute NCI Center for Cancer Research in collaboration with investigators from UPMC Hillman Cancer Center at the University of Pittsburgh have found that adjusting the composition of microorganisms in the intestines through fecal transplants can significantly improve the response to immunotherapyThe study focused on patients with advanced melanoma who had not responded to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors a type of immunotherapy However after receiving a transplant of fecal microbiota from a patient who had responded to the drug some of these patients showed a positive response This groundbreaking finding suggests that introducing specific fecal microorganisms into the colon can enhance the immune systems ability to recognize and eliminate tumor cellsDr Giorgio Trinchieri the chief of the Laboratory of Integrative Cancer Immunology at NCIs Center for Cancer Research highlighted the significance of this study In recent years immunotherapy drugs have benefited many cancer patients but we need new strategies to help those who do not respond he explained Our study is one of the first to demonstrate that altering the gut microbiome can improve the response to immunotherapy This provides proof of concept that the gut microbiome can be a therapeutic target in cancerWhile more research is needed to identify the specific microorganisms involved and understand the underlying mechanisms the study suggests that changing the gut microbiome can reprogram tumor microenvironments to make them more susceptible to immunotherapy Dr Trinchieri emphasized that larger clinical trials should be conducted to confirm these results and identify biological markers that can predict patient responseThe clinical trial conducted by the research team involved patients with advanced melanoma whose tumors had not responded to immune checkpoint inhibitors Fecal transplants were obtained from patients who had responded to pembrolizumab a commonly used immune checkpoint inhibitor The transplants were thoroughly analyzed to ensure safety and then delivered to the patients colons through colonoscopies Alongside the transplants the patients also received pembrolizumabThe results were promising with 6 out of 15 patients who had not responded to treatment showing either tumor reduction or longterm disease stabilization after the fecal transplants One patient even exhibited an ongoing partial response after more than two years The treatment was welltolerated with only minor side effects associated with pembrolizumabThe researchers also analyzed the gut microbiota of all patients and observed increased numbers of bacteria associated with the activation of immune cells and response to immunotherapy in those who had a positive response to the transplant Additionally changes in immune system molecules and biomarkers were observed further supporting the effectiveness of altering the gut microbiome in improving immunotherapy responseDr Amiran Dzutsev cofirst author of the study expressed optimism about future research We expect that future studies will identify which groups of bacteria in the gut are capable of converting nonresponsive patients into responders he stated This knowledge could lead to targeted delivery of critical microorganisms to patients who need them without the need for fecal transplantsIn conclusion this study provides compelling evidence that fecal microbiota transplants can help patients with cancers that do not respond to immunotherapy By altering the composition of microorganisms in the gut the immune systems ability to recognize and eliminate tumor cells can be enhanced While further research is necessary these findings pave the way for larger clinical trials and the development of targeted therapies based on the gut microbiome,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_role

Chemical from cactuslike plant shows promise in controlling surgical pain while leaving touch and coordination intact rat study showsPlant molecule could be used to block postoperative incisional painA promising approach to postoperative incisionsite pain control uses a naturally occurring plant molecule called resiniferatoxin RTX RTX is found in Euphorbia resinifera a cactuslike plant native to Morocco which is 500 times more potent than the chemical that produces heat in hot peppers and may help limit the use of opioid medication while in the hospital and during home recoveryIn a paper published online in Anesthesiology the peerreviewed medical journal of the American Society of Anesthesiologists researchers found that RTX could be used to block postoperative incisional pain in an animal model Many medical providers turn to opioids such as morphine or fentanyl for moderate to severe postoperative pain relief but these often come with side effects that can interfere with recovery including respiratory depression inhibition of gut motility and constipation nausea and vomiting Prolonged use of opioids can produce tolerance and introduces the risk of misuse RTX is not an opioid and does not act in the brain but rather on the nerve endings in the skin Scientists found that it can be used to block pain from the surgical incision selectively for approximately 10 daysIn the study researchers pretreated the skin incision site with RTX to render the nerve endings in the skin and subcutaneous tissue along the incision path selectively insensitive to pain Unlike local anesthetics which block all nerve activity including motor axons RTX allows many sensations like touch and vibration as well as muscle function to be preserved Long after the surgery and towards the end of healing of an incision wound the nerve endings eventually grow back Thus pain from the skin incision is reduced during the recovery periodRTX has been found to be a highly effective blocker of pain in multiple other preclinical animal models and is in a Phase I clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center for patients with severe pain associated with advanced cancerStephen J Raithel BA Matthew R Sapio PhD Danielle M LaPaglia BA Michael J Iadarola PhD Andrew J Mannes MD Transcriptional Changes in Dorsal Spinal Cord Persist after Surgical Incision Despite Preemptive Analgesia with Peripheral Resiniferatoxin Anesthesiology 2017About the NIH Clinical Center The NIH Clinical Center is the clinical research hospital for the National Institutes of Health Through clinical research clinicianinvestigators translate laboratory discoveries into better treatments therapies and interventions to improve the nations health More information httpsclinicalcenternihgovAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,real,0,VLPFN,0
The first 30 recipients of the new R35 Research Program Award RPA a pilot program designed to encourage creative research by enhancing funding stability have been announced by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS part of the National Institutes of Health NINDSsupported investigators who secure an RPA will have their research funded for a period of five years with the potential to have that funding extended for up to an additional three years This funding initiative was developed to provide support for a grantees overall research program not just individual projectsNINDS created this pilot program to improve the value of the research it funds by enabling proven investigators to pursue longrange innovative research instead of continually writing and submitting grant applications said Walter Koroshetz MD the NINDS directorTraditionally the R01 Research Project Grant has been the primary source of NIH funding for laboratories However R01 awards provide support for up to five years for a specific set of experiments and multiple R01s are often necessary to fund a laboratorys body of work The RPA which uses the R35 award mechanism differs in that it enhances funding stability by providing longer consolidated support for a grantees overall research program rather than for individual projectsThe RPA will support the entirety of an investigators program of NINDS missionrelated research The grantees current NINDS funding will be consolidated into the RPA and extended over a longer period During the fifth year of the award progress will be reviewed to ensure that the research program is staying on course NINDS anticipates that most RPA awardees will be given the option to continue receiving funding for three additional yearsApplications for the R35 RPA were reviewed according to NIH peer review standards which include an assessment of investigators track records and the significance and relevance of their proposed research programs The 30 awardees include principal investigators at a variety of career stages and a range of topics that include the use of models such as fruit flies and yeast to better understand neurodegenerative disease how the human brain forms and grows during development the molecular and cellular changes that give rise to memory wholegenome studies to determine how to promote neural repair mechanisms of pain and diseases of the brainOur goal with the R35 Research Program Award is to fund the research of both wellestablished investigators who already have multiple grants as well as earlier stage researchers with single R01s and a track record of significant impact in their field of study said Dr Robert Finkelstein PhD director of the Division of Extramural Activities NINDS

A firstinhuman trial evaluating an experimental treatment for Ebola virus disease has begun at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda Maryland The Phase 1 clinical trial is examining the safety and tolerability of a single monoclonal antibody called mAb114 which was developed by scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of NIH and their collaborators Investigators aim to enroll between 18 and 30 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 60 The trial will expose participants to the Ebola virusEbola virus disease is a serious and often fatal illness that can cause fever headache muscle pain weakness fatigue diarrhea vomiting stomach pain and hemorrhage severe bleeding It was first discovered in humans in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC and has caused periodic cases and outbreaks in several African countries since then The largest outbreak which occurred in West Africa from 2014 to 2016 caused more than 28600 infections and more than 11300 deaths according to the World Health Organization In May 2018 the DRC reported an Ebola outbreak located in quateur Province in the northwest of the country As of May 20 health officials have reported 51 probable or confirmed cases and 27 deaths There are currently no licensed treatments available for Ebola virus disease although multiple experimental therapies are being developedWe hope this trial will establish the safety of this experimental treatment for Ebola virus disease  an important first step in a larger evaluation process said NIAID Director Anthony S Fauci MD Ebola is highly lethal and reports of another outbreak in the DRC remind us that we urgently need Ebola treatmentsThis study adds to NIAID efforts in conducting scientifically and ethically sound biomedical research to develop countermeasures against Ebola virus disease added Dr FauciMAb114 is a monoclonal antibody  a protein that binds to a single target on a pathogen  isolated from a human survivor of the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit a city in the DRC Nancy Sullivan PhD chief of the Biodefense Research Section in NIAIDs Vaccine Research Center VRC and her team in collaboration with researchers from the National Institute of Biomedical Research INRB in the DRC and the Institute for Biomedical Research in Switzerland discovered that the survivor retained antibodies against Ebola 11 years after infection They isolated the antibodies and tested the most favorable ones in the laboratory and nonhuman primate studies and selected mAb114 as the most promising Professor JeanJacques Muyembe director general of INRB and one of the scientists involved in the original detection of the Ebola virus in 1976 played a key role in discovering mAb114In collaboration with the VRC scientists at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College Hanover New Hampshire illustrated that the monoclonal antibody binds to the hardtoreach core of the Ebola virus surface protein and blocks the proteins interaction with its receptor on human cells A single dose of mAb114 protected nonhuman primates days after lethal Ebola virus infection The antibody was developed in partnership with the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency It was manufactured for clinical studies by the company MedImmune based in Gaithersburg MarylandThe discovery and development of this experimental Ebola treatment was a collaborative process made possible by Ebola survivors and the DRC scientists who first encountered the virus as well as through collaboration with our colleagues in the Department of Defense We are pleased to announce the start of this Phase 1 trial of mAb114 said NIAID VRC Director John Mascola MDMartin Gaudinski MD medical director in the VRCs Clinical Trials Program is the principal investigator of the new trial The first three participants will receive a 5 milligram mgkilogram kg intravenous infusion of mAb114 for 30 minutes The study monitoring team will evaluate safety data to determine if the remaining participants can receive higher doses 25 mgkg and 50 mgkg Participants will have blood taken before and after the infusion and will bring a diary card home to record their temperature and any symptoms for three days Participants will visit the clinic approximately 14 times over six months to have their blood drawn to see if mAb114 is detectable and to be checked for any health changesInvestigators expect that the trial called VRC 608 will be fully enrolled by July 2018 For more

A Phase 1 clinical trial to test the safety and tolerability of an investigational vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus RSV has begun at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda Maryland The trial also will assess the vaccines ability to prompt an immune response in healthy adult participants The investigational vaccine was developed by scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of NIHMost people are infected with RSV by age 2 and undergo repeated infections throughout life Infected adults and children generally experience mild coldlike symptoms that resolve within a week or two However infection can cause severe lower respiratory tract disease including pneumonia and bronchiolitis among premature infants children younger than age 2 with heart or lung problems children and adults with weakened immune systems and the elderly About 2 percent of RSVinfected infants under 1 year of age require hospitalization Children between ages 1 and 5 years and adults older than 65 years are also at higher risk of hospitalizationEach year on average in the United States RSV leads to 57527 hospitalizations and 21 million outpatient visits among children younger than 5 years and 177000 hospitalizations and 14000 deaths among adults older than 65 years according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Globally RSV infections are estimated to cause more than 250000 deaths each yearCurrently no vaccine to prevent RSV infection or drug to treat it is available The monoclonal antibody palivizumab is licensed in the US for preventing serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in highrisk children but it is not licensed for use in the general populationRSV is underappreciated as a major cause of illness and death not only in infants and children but also in people with weakened immune systems and the elderly said NIAID Director Anthony S Fauci MD A vaccine to reduce the burden of this important disease is badly neededThe study called VRC 317 will enroll healthy adults ages 1850 years Participants will be randomly assigned to receive two injections in the arm at 12 weeks apart with either the investigational vaccine or the investigational vaccine adjuvanted with alum Alum is a chemical compound commonly added to vaccines to enhance the bodys immune responseParticipants will also be randomly assigned to receive one of three vaccine doses 50 micrograms 150 micrograms or 500 micrograms at both vaccination time points Initially five people will be vaccinated with the 50 microgram dose If the initial group of participants experience no serious adverse reactions attributable to the vaccine the study team will then begin to vaccinate participants at the next dosage level They will repeat this stepwise process until they administer the 500 microgram doseParticipants will return for 12 clinic visits over 44 weeks after the first injection At these visits study clinicians will conduct physical exams and collect blood samples They will also test mucous samples from volunteers mouths and noses to measure the immune responses generatedThe study is being led by principal investigator Michelle C Crank MD head of the Translational Sciences Core in the Viral Pathogenesis Laboratory part of NIAIDs Vaccine Research Center VRC Study clinicians will conduct a daily safety review of any new clinical information and a Protocol Safety Review Team will examine trial safety data weekly to ensure the vaccine meets safety standardsThe investigational vaccine called DSCav1 results from years of research led by Barney S Graham MD PhD deputy VRC director and Peter D Kwong PhD chief of the Structural Biology Section and the Structural Bioinformatics Core at the VRC The vaccine candidate is a single structurallyengineered protein from the surface of RSV rather than a more traditional approach based on a weakened or inactivated whole virus In 2013 VRC scientists tested several versions of the protein as a vaccine in mice and nonhuman primates The protein variants elicited high levels of neutralizing antibodies and protected the animals against RSV infection Drs Graham and Kwong selected the most promising candidate DSCav1 for clinical evaluationThis work represents an example of how new biological insights from basic research can lead to candidate vaccines for diseases of public health importance and the value of multidisciplinary research teams like the ones assembled at the VRC said Dr GrahamThe trial is

Dec 27 2022  Drinking two or more cups of coffee daily is linked to double the risk of death from heart disease if you have severe high blood pressure a new study from Japan suggests Previous studies have found that coffee consumption can reduce the risk of high blood pressure and death but those studies didnt differentiate among people with different levels of high blood pressure according to study author Masayuki Teramoto MD MPH of The University of California in San Francisco Caffeines harmful effects may outweigh its protective effects in persons with severe hypertension and increase the risk of mortality Teramoto says The study also looked at green tea consumption and found no link with heart disease death at any blood pressure level For the study published Dec 21 in the Journal of theAmerican Heart Association researchers analyzed the blood pressure levels plus coffee and green tea consumption of 18609 Japanese people ages 40 to 75 Sixtyfive percent were women None Optimal and normal less than 13085 Coffee consumption was categorized as occasionally or none less than one cup one cup and two or more cups per day For green tea consumption the categories were occasionally or none less than one cup one or two cups  three or four cups five or six cups and seven or more cups per day A total of 842 heart disease deaths occurred during the followup period at about 19 years Coffee consumption was related to increased heart risk only among those who started the study with severe hypertension grade 2 or 3 Compared with noncoffee drinkers their risk of heart disease death doubled with two or more cups of coffee per day Green tea consumption was not associated with an increased risk of death from heart disease at any blood pressure level Rather frequent consumption was associated with lower total cholesterol level among those with severe hypertensionMore research is needed in different populations to confirm the study results Teramoto says The study is unique in that it looks separately at risk associated with coffee and tea intake across different ranges of blood pressure says American Heart Association Nutrition Committee Chair Christopher Gardner PhD But the studys many categories for blood pressure and coffee and tea consumption made for very small subgroups for analysis For example only 19 2 of the 842 deaths were in the severe hypertension group The small subgroups also limited the researchers ability to accurately calculate any benefits of coffee or green tea at any blood pressure level Whats more Gardner notes that the researchers didnt look at what people put into their coffee and tea Black coffee and a mochafrappacappuccino might both qualify as coffee but the latter is a sugarandsaturated fat delivery vehicle Green tea and bobabubble tea are similar in terms of both possibly qualifying as tea but the latter is more of a teaflavoredbeverage with sugar and dairy and other additives People need to know that even if they dont have high blood pressure or if they have mild hypertension they should not feel free to increase their consumption of coffeelike and tealike beverages which could be harmful because of the additives Gardner says And if you have severe high blood pressure limit your coffee consumption to less than two cups per day until more research results are available Gardner advises,real,0,VLPFN,0
AUG 12 2022  Bowing to consumer demand for safe and natural products Johnson  Johnson is transitioning its baby powder from talcbased to an allcornstarch formula The companys decision comes as a strategic move to maintain its market share and uphold its reputation within the fiercely competitive beauty industryThe international consultancy firm announced Thursday that the globally renowned Johnsons Baby Powder will be updated to an all cornstarchbased portfolio marking a major shift in its product lineup The phased replacement is expected to happen by 2023This announcement follows JJs 2020 decision to halt US sales of their talcbased baby powder amidst a consumer backlash that resulted in significant financial and reputational damage The company faced thousands of lawsuits many of which alleged that the talc used in Johnson and Johnsons baby powder was lethally toxic and caused severe ailments including ovarian cancerThese legal battles cost JJ millions in damages and settlements a financial burden which was ultimately passed onto the shareholders The lawsuits underscored the urgent need for safer more natural products in an increasingly healthconscious consumer marketDespite being held liable in several lawsuits JJ continues to passionately defend the safety of its original talcbased formula In a public statement the company insisted that the product does not contain asbestos and therefore posed no risk of causing cancer The company maintains that their powder is backed by decades of scientific research proving its safety Despite this the consumer desire for more natural cornstarchbased alternatives is inevitably changing the course of JJs product roadmap,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt4

According to a new report by the nonprofit research organization NORC at the University of Chicago just 141 of cancer cases in the United States are diagnosed through recommended screening tests This finding has surprised many as there is often an assumption that most cancers are detected through screening However the reality is that the majority of cancers are actually found when individuals seek medical attention for unrelated reasonsCaroline Pearson an author of the report and senior vice president at NORC expressed her shock at the low percentage of cancers detected through screening She highlighted that the constant focus on cancer screening such as mammograms and colonoscopies may lead people to believe that this is the primary method of diagnosis for all cancers However this is not the caseThe US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screenings for breast cervical colorectal and lung cancer These screenings have varying success rates in detecting cancers For example screenings for breast and cervical cancer have been found to detect around 30 of cases while colorectal cancer screenings detect approximately 25 of cases Lung cancer screenings have a lower success rate detecting only 10 of casesThe report also addressed prostate cancer although screenings for it are not widely recommended Nonetheless the report suggests that screenings can detect around 77 of prostate cancers This highlights the potential benefits of screenings for certain types of cancer despite the overall low percentage of cancers detected through screening,llm fake,2,VLPFN,QA
NIHs All of Us Research Program Releases First Genomic Dataset of Nearly 100000 Whole Genome SequencesContributions from diverse participants set to change the landscape of genomics researchNearly 100000 highly diverse whole genome sequences are now available through the National Institutes of Healths All of Us Research Program About 50 of the data is from individuals who identify with racial or ethnic groups that have historically been underrepresented in research This data will enable researchers to address yet unanswerable questions about health and disease leading to new breakthroughs and advancing discoveries to reduce persistent health disparitiesUntil now over 90 of participants from large genomics studies have been of European descent The lack of diversity in research has hindered scientific discovery said Josh Denny MD chief executive officer of the All of Us Research Program All of Us participants are leading the way toward more equitable representation in medical research through their involvement And this is just the beginning Over time as we expand our data and add new tools this dataset will become an indispensable resource for health researchThe genomic data is available via a cloudbased platform the All of Us Researcher Workbench and also includes genotyping arrays from 165000 participants Whole genome sequencing provides information about almost all of an individuals genetic makeup while genotyping arrays the more commonly used genetic testing approach capture a specific subset of the genomeIn addition to the genomic data the Workbench contains information from many of the participants electronic health records Fitbit devices and survey responses The platform also links to data from the Census Bureaus American Community Survey to provide more details about the communities where participants live This combination of data will allow researchers to better understand how genes can cause or influence diseases in the context of other health determinants The ultimate goal is to enable more precise approaches to health care for all populations To protect participants privacy the program has removed all direct identifiers from the data and upholds strict requirements for researchers seeking accessThere is a unique depth and dimensionality to the All of Us platform that sets it apart from other resources in the field Its also designed with team science in mind allowing researchers to explore topics in an open and collaborative way said Gail Jarvik MD PhD head of the Division of Medical Genetics at the University of Washington School of Medicine Seattle As the Researcher Workbench matures it will create nearly endless possibilities for discovery to understand the role of genes and variants as well as many other factors that combine to affect health and diseaseThe Researcher Workbench is made possible through the generous contributions of All of Us participants Beyond making genomic data available for research All of Us participants have the opportunity to receive personal DNA results at no cost to them So far the program has offered genetic ancestry and trait results to more than 100000 participants Plans are underway to begin to share healthrelated DNA results on hereditary disease risk and medicationgene interactions later this yearWith this release of genomic data All of Us now ranks among other large genomic research efforts worldwide including the UK Biobank the Million Veteran Program and the NIHs TransOmics for Precision Medicine TOPMed programAll of Us works with a

Article The Devastating Effects of Strokes  Are You at RiskStrokes also known as brain attacks are a silent killer that can strike anyone at any time When blood flow to the brain is suddenly cut off brain cells are deprived of vital oxygen and glucose leading to their untimely death The consequences can be catastrophic resulting in permanent brain damage or even deathIt is a terrifying reality that strokes often occur without warning leaving victims and their loved ones helpless and unprepared Unlike other medical emergencies there are no clear signs or symptoms that can alert us to the impending danger This means that by the time a stroke is recognized it may already be too late to prevent the devastating consequencesThe grim truth is that strokes are a ticking time bomb waiting to strike when we least expect it No amount of precautionary measures or regular checkups can guarantee our safety The unpredictability of strokes is a chilling reminder of our vulnerability in the face of such a merciless enemyIn the battle against strokes we are left defenseless with no control over when or how they will strike It is a stark reminder of the fragility of life and the harsh reality that we are mere pawns in the hands of fate The only solace we can find is in the knowledge that we are not alone in this fight Together we can raise awareness and support research to find a cure for this silent killerSo the next time you hear about strokes remember that they are not just a medical condition They are a wakeup call a reminder of the fragility of life and a call to action Let us unite in the fight against strokes and strive to make a difference in the lives of those affected by this devastating condition,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt35
Artificial pancreas technology may not be as effective as claimed in improving blood glucose control in young children with type 1 diabetes according to a study conducted at three pediatric diabetes centers in the United States The study funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases NIDDK found that the artificial pancreas group did spend slightly more time within their target blood glucose range compared to the standard care group but the difference was not significant enough to support the widespread use of the technologyThe artificial pancreas also known as closedloop control is a system that combines a continuous glucose monitor CGM and an insulin pump to automatically regulate insulin delivery based on blood glucose levels However the study found that the artificial pancreas did not provide substantial improvements in blood glucose control particularly at nighttime which is a critical time for managing diabetes in childrenThe trial enrolled 102 participants between the ages of 2 and 5 a challenging population when it comes to glycemic control Participants were randomly assigned to either the artificial pancreas group or the standard care comparison group The artificial pancreas group received training on how to use the study device while the standard care group continued to use their prestudy method of blood glucose managementDuring the 13week trial participants in the artificial pancreas group spent only 12 more time within their target blood glucose range compared to the standard care group which amounts to approximately three extra hours per day The difference in blood glucose control was most noticeable at nighttime with the artificial pancreas group spending 18 more time in range than the standard care group However these improvements were not significant enough to justify the use of the artificial pancreas technologyThe study also raised concerns about the safety of using the artificial pancreas device in young children While similar numbers of severe hypoglycemia occurred in both study groups there was one instance of diabetic ketoacidosis in the artificial pancreas group due to a problem with the insulin pump tubingThe trial was conducted at three reputable pediatric diabetes centers in the United States However due to the pandemic restrictions at the time of the study most of the device trainings and study visits were conducted virtually This raises questions about the realworld applicability of the technology particularly in remote and underserved areasIt is important to note that the study was funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases which may introduce bias in the interpretation of the results Further independent research is needed to validate the findings of this study and determine the true effectiveness and safety of artificial pancreas technology in young children with type 1 diabetesIn conclusion while the study suggests some minor improvements in blood glucose control with the use of artificial pancreas technology the findings are not conclusive enough to support its widespread adoption Further research is needed to assess the longterm effects and safety of the technology in young children with type 1 diabetes,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_all
Memory T cells shelter in bone marrow boosting immunity in mice with restricted dietsEven when taking in fewer calories and nutrients humans and other mammals usually remain protected against infectious diseases they have already encountered This may be because memory T cells which are located throughout the body and required to maintain immune responses to infectious agents according to scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of the National Institutes of Health Their study in mice published online today in Cell also found that animals undergoing dietary restriction were better protected against tumors and bacterial infections than animals with unrestricted dietsResearchers led by Yasmine Belkaid PhD chief of the Metaorganism Immunity Section in NIAIDs Division of Intramural Research previously observed that fat tissue harbors memory T cells in mice They investigated whether this phenomenon helped preserve immune memory when calorie intake was reduced To investigate they restricted the diet of mice previously given full access to food While receiving less food mice had fewer memory T cells in their lymphoid tissues where they normally linger and more of the T cells in bone marrow that became enriched with fat tissueInvestigators then evaluated how well memory T cells performed when mice ate less While eating freely mice were infected with the bacterium Yersinia pseudotuberculosis After the mice developed immunological memory researchers restricted the diets of some of the mice for up to four weeks before again exposing all the mice to Y pseudotuberculosis Mice with restricted diets had more robust memory T cell responses and were better protected from illness The researchers repeated this experiment using a vaccine that trains immune cells to fight melanomas and found that memory T cells were more protective against tumors in mice receiving less foodThough this phenomenon has yet to be studied in humans the findings suggest how the immune system may have evolved to help mammals survive periods of limited food availability while keeping their immunity intact These results in lab animals cannot be extrapolated to dietary advice for people However these insights may one day help clinicians improve immunotherapy for cancers and other diseases by optimizing nutritionN Collins et al The bone marrow protects and optimizes immunological memory during dietary restriction Cell DOI 101016jcell201907049 2019Yasmine Belkaid PhD the lead author director of the NIAID Microbiome Program and chief of the Metaorganism Immunity Section in the Laboratory of Immune System Biology of NIAIDs Division of Intramural Research is available for commentThis press release describes a basic research finding Basic research increases our understanding of human behavior and biology which is foundational to advancing new and better ways to prevent diagnose and treat disease Science is an unpredictable and incremental process  each research advance builds on past discoveries often in unexpected ways Most clinical advances would not be possible without the knowledge of fundamental basic researchNIAID conducts and supports research  at NIH throughout the United States and worldwide  to study the causes of infectious and immunemediated diseases and to develop better means of preventing diagnosing and treating these illnesses News releases fact sheets and other NIAIDrelated materials are available on the NIAID websiteAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,real,0,VLPFN,0

Children born to mothers who both drank and smoked beyond the first trimester of pregnancy have a 12fold increased risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome SIDS compared to those unexposed or only exposed in the first trimester of pregnancy according to a new study supported by the National Institutes of HealthSIDS is the sudden unexplained death of an infant under 1 year of age Many studies have shown that the risk of SIDS is increased by maternal smoking during pregnancy Some studies have also found that prenatal alcohol exposure particularly from heavy drinking during pregnancy can increase SIDS risk Now the NIHfunded Safe Passage Study provides a look at how SIDS risk is influenced by the timing and amount of prenatal exposure to tobacco and alcohol A report of the study appears in EclinicalMedicine an online journal published by The LancetOurs is the first largescale prospective study to closely investigate the association between prenatal alcohol and tobacco exposure and the risk of SIDS said first author Amy J Elliott PhD of the Avera Health Center for Pediatric  Community Research in Sioux Falls South Dakota Our findings suggest that combined exposures to alcohol and tobacco have a synergistic effect on SIDS risk given that dual exposure was associated with substantially higher risk than either exposure aloneTo conduct the study a multicenter team of scientists from throughout the US and in South Africa formed the Prenatal Alcohol in SIDS and Stillbirth PASS Network From 2007 until 2015 PASS Network researchers followed the outcomes of nearly 12000 pregnancies among women from two residential areas in Cape Town South Africa and five sites in the US including two American Indian Reservations in South Dakota and North Dakota The study sites were selected for their high rates of prenatal alcohol use and SIDS and to include populations where the ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in SIDS remains understudiedThe researchers determined oneyear outcomes for about 94 of the pregnancies They found that 66 infants died during that time including 28 SIDS deaths and 38 deaths from known causes In addition to the almost 12fold increased SIDS risk from combined smoking and drinking beyond the first trimester of pregnancy they determined that the risk of SIDS was increased fivefold in infants whose mothers reported they continued smoking beyond the first trimester and fourfold in infants whose mothers reported they continued drinking beyond the first trimester These risks were in comparison to infants who were either not exposed to tobacco or alcohol during gestation or whose mothers quit tobacco or alcohol use by the end of the first trimesterThe Safe Passage Study provides important new information about the role of dual exposures to prenatal smoking and drinking as risk factors for SIDS said cofirst author Hannah C Kinney MD of the Department of Pathology at Boston Childrens Hospital and Harvard School of Medicine Our findings support the current recommendation of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the US Surgeon General and the World Health Organization that women not drink or smoke during pregnancy and emphasizes the significance of dual exposure which provides the greatest risk for infant mortalityIn a joint statement the leaders of the NIH institutes that provide primary funding for the Safe Passage Study saidThese findings provide still more evidence of the vital importance of the early prenatal environment to healthy postnatal outcomes Insofar as many women quit drinking and smoking only after they learn that they are pregnant this study argues strongly for screening for substance use early in pregnancy and intervening as soon as possible It also calls for stronger public health messaging regarding the dangers of drinking and smoking during pregnancy and among women who plan to become pregnantDiana W Bianchi MD Director Eunice Kennedy Shriver National

NIH scientists show how tularemia bacteria trick cells to cause diseaseFrancisella tularensis is the bacterium that causes tularemia a lifethreatening disease spread to humans via contact with an infected animal or through mosquito tick or deer fly bites As few as 10 viable bacteria can cause the disease which has a death rate of up to 60 percent Scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  part of the National Institutes of Health  have unraveled the process by which the bacteria cause disease They found that F tularensis tricks host cell mitochondria which produce energy for the cell in two different phases of infection In the first eight hours of infection the bacteria increase mitochondria function which inhibits cell death and prevents the cell from mounting an inflammatory response to avoid an immune system attack In the 24 hours after the bacteria impair mitochondrial function undergo explosive replication and spread These basic science findings could play a role in developing effective treatment strategies according to the researchersPreviously researchers discovered that F tularensis could inhibit inflammation following infection of immune system cells called macrophages but they did not understand how it occurred The new study published in Infection and Immunity illuminates that process confirming that the bacteriums manipulation of the mitochondrial machinery in the host cell is required to block strong inflammatory responses Also the researchers show that the timing of the manipulation of the mitochondria machinery during infection is important to how the bacteria control host cell death The researchers also said this could be the first study to show that a bacteriums sugarlike protective outer capsule or polysaccharide can increase mitochondria function in this case during early infectionThe researchers believe that better antimicrobial treatment strategies  against F tularensis and possibly other pathogens  could result from further study of the role the capsule polysaccharide plays in manipulating mitochondria For example learning how to block the increased mitochondrial function in phase one could limit infection they say In their study they also treated F tularensisinfected macrophages in the laboratory with two types of drugs that protect mitochondria The treatment reduced cell death and limited bacterial replication The group plans to extend that work to miceF Jessop et al Temporal manipulation of mitochondrial function by virulent Francisella tularensis to limit inflammation and control cell death Infection and Immunity DOI 101128IAI0004418 2018Catharine Bosio PhD chief of NIAIDs Immunity to Pulmonary Pathogens Section is available to comment on this studyThis press release describes a basic research finding Basic research increases our understanding of human behavior and biology which is foundational to advancing new and better ways to prevent diagnose and treat disease Science is an unpredictable and incremental process  each research advance builds on past discoveries often in unexpected ways Most clinical advances would not be possible without the knowledge of fundamental basic researchNIAID conducts and supports research  at NIH throughout the United States and worldwide  to study the causes of infectious and immunemediated diseases and to develop better means of preventing diagnosing and treating these illnesses News releases fact sheets and other NIAIDrelated materials are available on the NIAID websiteAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,real,0,VLPFN,0
A report that was quietly published by the UK Government just hours before Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his resignation reveals that Covid19 deaths have risen dramatically among the triple vaccinated population in England over the past couple of months whilst declining drastically among the unvaccinated populationWith the most recent figures showing the vaccinated population in England accounted for a shocking 94 of all Covid19 Deaths in April and May and 90 of those deaths were among the triplequadruple vaccinated populationLets not lose touchYour Government and Big Tech are actively trying to censor the information reported by The Expos to serve their own needs Subscribe now to make sure you receive the latest uncensored news in your inboxFollow The Exposs Official Channel on Telegram hereJoin the conversation in our Telegram Discussion Group hereOn the 7th July Boris Johnson the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom announced he was resigning Since then the Mainstream Media in the UK have distracted the public with 247 news on that announcement and speculation on who could replace himIts times like these that you ought to watch what bad news is being quietly published in the background in the hope that it wont receive much attention and it just so happens that hours before Boris announced his resignation his Government published new data that proves things have been terrible for the vaccinated population in England over the past couple of monthsBack in March 2022 the UK Health Security Agency announced that from April 1st 2022 they would no longer publish the vaccination status of Covid19 cases hospitalisations and deaths in EnglandAt the time the UKHSA claimed this was because the UK Government had ended free universal Covid19 testing and this therefore affected their ability to robustly monitor Covid19 cases by vaccination statusHowever this was a lieThe UK Health Security Agency had been looking for an excuse for months to stop publishing the data because it clearly showed the vaccinated population were suffering immense immune system damage with case hospitalisation and death rates per 100000 highest among the fully vaccinated populationThe following chart shows the real world Covid19 vaccine effectiveness among the triple vaccinated population in England in the Week 3 Week 7 and Week 13 UKHSA Vaccine Surveillance reports of 2022 This was nowhere near the claimed 95 effectiveness by Pfizer was itBut now we have more evidence to both prove the UKHSA was lying and that the current mainstream media storm surrounding the resignation of Boris Johnson is just a distractionThis is because another UK Government agency known as the Office for National Statistics ONS has just published data on deaths by vaccination statusThe latest dataset from the ONS is titled Deaths by Vaccination Status England 1 January 2021 to 31 May 2022 and it can be accessed on the ONS site here and downloaded hereTable 1 of the latest dataet contains figures on the mortality rates by vaccination status for all cause deaths deaths involving Covid19 and deaths not involving Covid19 And it is here that we are able to ascertain the vaccination status of everyone who has died of Covid19 since the beginning of April 2022 when the UKHSA claimed they could no longer reliably report the figuresHeres how the ONS presents the figures for the month of April 2022 Source  Table 1Weve taken the figures provided by the ONS for both April and May 2022 and produced the following chart showing Covid19 deaths by vaccination status in England between 1st April and 31st May 2022 In all according to the ONS there were 4935 Covid19 deaths over these two months and the vaccinated population accounted for a shocking 4647 of those deaths But whats even more shocking is that the triple vaccinated accounted for 4216 of those deaths with just 288 deaths recorded among the unvaccinated populationIn March 2022 there were 321 Covid19 deaths within 60 days of a positive test among the unvaccinated population according to the UKHSA Week 13 Vaccine Surveillance Report as detailed in the following chart using data extracted from table 13b of the report This means there were 33 less deaths among the unvaccinated over two months April and May than there were in the whole of MarchUnfortunately the opposite is true for the vaccinated population especially the triple vaccinated There were 911 more deaths among the vaccinated over two months and 1161 more death among the triple vaccinatedThis means deaths have fallen drastically among the unvaccinated but increased significantly among the vaccinated population since the UKHSA claimed they could no longer reliably publish the dataThe following chart shows the percentage of Covid19 deaths by vaccination status in England between 1st April and 31st May 2022 according to the latest ONS dataset published just hours before Boris Johnsons resignation The quietly published figures reveal that the vaccinated population as a whole accounted for a shocking 94 of all Covid19 deaths in April and May 2022 with the unvaccinated accounting for just 6 of all Covid19 deaths But the most horrific statistic here is that 90 of the deaths among the vaccinated were among people who had been given at least three doses of a Covid19 injectionHowever many in the UK have been given a fourth dose of a Covid19 injection since the spring and judging by the latest data from the Government of Cananda its likely many of those deaths could actually be among the quadruple vaccinatedThe most recent Government of Canada figures show that there were 521 Covid19 deaths between 6th and 12th June and the vaccinated population accounted for 485 of them with a shocking 242 deaths among the quadruple vaccinated population meaning they accounted for 50 of Covid19 deaths among the vaccinated in the second week of June 2022These arent the kind of figures you would expect to see if the Covid19 injections really are up to 95 effective at preventing death are theySo there you have it whilst youve been distracted by Boris Johnsons resignation as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom the UK Government quietly published a report just hours before his announcement containing data they previously claimed they didnt have which confirmed the vaccinated now account for 94 of Covid19 deaths in England and 90 of those deaths are among the triple vaccinatedWith news like this being swept under the rug by the mainstream media it makes you wonder what else they will attempt to hide in the coming weeks,human fake,1,VLPFN,0
May 5 2023  A study conducted in Sweden has found evidence that COVID19 vaccines have a significant impact on womens menstrual cycles The study which analyzed data from nearly 3 million women was initiated following reports from women who experienced changes in their cycles after vaccination The researchers observed that women who received a third vaccine dose had an increased risk of postmenopausal bleeding While the study acknowledged that menstrual cycles naturally vary and minor disturbances are common the findings highlight the need to address concerns about adverse reactions during mass vaccination campaignsThe study published in The BMJ examined data from women aged 12 to 74 years old who received Pfizer Moderna or AstraZeneca vaccines between December 2020 and February 2022 Out of the 29 million women included in the study over 25 million received at least one dose of the vaccine with more than half receiving three doses The researchers analyzed data from primary care or specialist visits and hospital stays evaluating the impact of the vaccines within 1 to 7 days and within 8 to 90 days after vaccination They specifically looked for menstrual disturbances such as changes in cycle days unusual bleeding and postmenopausal bleedingWhile the study identified weak and inconsistent associations between vaccination and menstrual changes and postmenopausal bleeding no strong patterns were found to conclude that the vaccines were the cause of these issues The Swedish study is the largest examination conducted so far on the relationship between COVID19 vaccination and menstrual changes providing valuable insights into the topic However further research is needed to better understand the potential impact of COVID19 vaccines on womens menstrual cycles,llm fake,2,VLPFN,QA

The highly anticipated results of the monoclonal antibody LYCoV555s trial unveiled quite an unsatisfactory picture The experimental COVID19 treatment according to The New England Journal of Medicine failed to outperform a placebo in delivering benefits to hospitalized patientsDespite its partnership with the esteemed Accelerating COVID19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines ACTIV program LYCoV555 underperformed compared to its placebo counterpart during the trial The unexpected result raised eyebrows among the medical community given the ample investments funneled into its developmentAdding to the bleak outlook the involvement of the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board DSMB signaled early concerns regarding the antibodys effectiveness The DSMB recommended a stoppage of its usage leading to a halt in new enrollments since late October  a testament to the serious doubts surrounding LYCoV555Dimming the once promising beacon of hope AbCellera Biologics and Lilly Research Laboratories investment into the development of LYCoV555 exhibited a subpar performance The antibodys ineffectiveness against a mere placebo leaves a lot to question about the viability of such significant monetary commitments into experimental treatmentsWhile the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization EUA to LYCoV555 for nonhospitalized patients at elevated risk of severe COVID19 the scrutinizing trail results put its true efficacy into question creating a confusing picture for the medical fraternityAs the ACTIV3 trial unfolds globally across various existing clinical trials networks the failure of LYCoV555 serves as a daunting indication The underwhelming results could potentially cast a shadow over the reputation of the network and the ACTIV program Such setbacks are a clear warning of the volatility that exists within the race for effective COVID19 therapeutics,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt4
March 10 2023  A new study conducted by Swiss researchers reveals alarming findings regarding the longterm effects of the Omicron variant of COVID19 Contrary to previous beliefs health care workers infected with Omicron are still at risk of experiencing persistent postCOVID symptoms even 18 months later While some studies have suggested a lower risk of long COVID with Omicron compared to other variants this research indicates that the situation may not be as hopeful as it seems Experts warn that the long COVID wave following Omicron infections could still be devastating contrary to previous assumptions The study which is yet to be published in a medical journal tracked 1201 health care workers and found that those infected with the original virus had a significantly higher risk of developing long COVID symptoms Meanwhile the chances of developing long COVID among workers infected with Omicron were still present debunking the previous belief that this variant had a lower risk It is essential to consider these findings seriously and understand the potential longterm consequences of the Omicron variant,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_sem
Aug 16 2022  A growing bandwagon of TikTok influencers has been using and promoting calamine lotion as a makeup primer under foundation While this may work as a base layer for some people dermatologists have concerns about this trend particularly the risk of dryness As of Aug 12 the  calamine lotion tag had more than 208 million views on TikTok with hundreds of videos hailing the cream for its opaque pink tint and matte effect when used under foundation Calamine lotion has been used to treat itchy rashes insect bites and pain from chickenpox and poison ivy for years Its sold over the counter and is a common treatment for skin discomfort says Doris Day MD a dermatologist in New York City It is also on the World Health Organizations list of essential drugs she says This is something that has been around for a long time Its recognized as a drug that has importance So every now and then I guess somebody comes across it and says its a new panacea for something but its really not Its just an oldtime simple product Calamine lotion is made of ferric oxide and zinc oxide which gives it its antiseptic and antiitch properties in addition to its characteristic pink color Zinc oxide is also commonly used in mineral sunscreens Day says Though these ingredients are safe with temporary localized use high concentrations and chronic use of calamine lotion can be irritating to the skin says Pooja Sodha MD director of the Center for Laser and Cosmetic Dermatology at George Washington University in Washington DC At these high concentrations calamine lotion can be drying which may cause skin clumping and can be abrasive says Sodha She also cautions that the astringent properties of the zinc and the high pH may disrupt proteins on the skin which breaks down the skins natural defenses Using calamine lotion all over the face daily can potentially damage your skin barrier to a point where youre going to have to do a lot of extra work  to bring it backDay also worries about this trend resulting in dry skin Even in situations where using calamine lotion is appropriate like treating poison ivy its drying effects can sometimes irritate the skin And dry skin can be more than an aesthetic issue It can lead to breaks in the skin which can result in infections and scarring she says While this may not occur in someone with extremely oily skin most people dont have extremely oily skin says Day so this will be ineffective at best and damaging at worst If someone is looking for a good makeup base layer Sodha recommends something thats noncomedogenic and nonsensitizing like siliconbased primers The great thing about these products is that they are noncomedogenic so they wont clog your pores Theyre synthetic so theyre not going to cause some sort of allergy she says In general both dermatologists warn their patients to be wary of the TikTok trends they see online and caution about possible effects with longterm use of calamine lotion on the face even if it appears to work with one use Consumers have to think about this like they do with any sort of product that they come across just thinking about the longterm effects of something like this and how it works for their own skin says Sodha,real,0,VLPFN,0

Feb 16 2023  A highly infectious strain of bird flu  known as H5N1 is sweeping across the globe devastating backyard flocks and commercial farms alike While this virus mostly infects birds growing reports of mammals infected with the virus have some experts worried The main concern they say is as H5N1 continues to spread and multiply in different species there are more opportunities for the virus to potentially gain mutations that could help it more easily infect humans Just by the sheer numbers game the more chances it has to infect humans or other mammals the more chance youre going to get that rare event happening says Richard Webby PhD the director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds at St Jude Childrens Hospital in Memphis Since May 2022 the US Department of Agriculture has detected 121 mammals infected with the H5N1 virus including red foxes skunks bears and even seals In October 2022 an outbreak at a mink farm in Spain resulted in the culling of over 51000 animals and earlier this month Peru confirmed 585 sea lions had died from the virus in coastal nature preserves While H5N1 infections have been detected in mammals over the past 25 years were certainly seeing an uptick in reported cases over the past 12 months Webby says The World Health Organization has stated that the risk to humans remains low but we cannot assume that will remain the case and we must prepare for any change in the status quo WHO DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus PhD said at a news briefing this month H5N1 infections in humans are rare They mostly happen when someone has unprotected direct exposure to birds infected with H5N1 or surfaces contaminated with the virus Since 1997 there have been about 870 human cases reported to the WHO with roughly half dying from the infection Even if someone is infected with the virus it is even rarer that the infection would spread to another humanH5N1 viruses currently circulating in wild birds and causing poultry outbreaks are welladapted to spread among birds Tim Uyeki MD chief medical officer of the Influenza Divisions Office of the Director at the CDC said in an online QA However these H5N1 bird flu viruses do not have the ability to easily bind to receptors in the upper respiratory tract of humans or to transmit among people Even with the recordbreaking numbers of infected wild birds and poultry human infections have become rarer in the last few years Since the beginning of this century it was not uncommon to have at least 30 to 40 recorded human H5N1 per year Since 2021 there have been fewer than 10 infections reported around the world according to the CDC H5N1 infections in wild mammals are not unheard of though they are also rare events Most of these cases likely occur when an animal eats an infected bird and is exposed to the virus Like in humans these infections have been sporadic But a report last month about an outbreak at a mink farm in Spain caused experts to worry as the researchers suggested the virus may have spread by one mink infecting others Minks are related to ferrets which scientists use as an animal model for studying flu transmission If we see something that transmits in mink its not a stretch to think Maybe that is something that could also transmit in ferrets Webby says We certainly would use transmission in ferrets as an alarm bell for human risk But so far there is no evidence that the virus has picked up the ability to more easily infect humans says William Schaffner MD a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville In fact one of the reassuring things is in that mink farm in Spain the people who work on the farm  and had very close contact with those mink  were all tested and they were found to be negative he says The minks were also very closely confined in cages  which may have aided spread of the virus he notesThe more recent report of infections in sea lions had some people speculating online about possible spread of the virus among the animals but these marine mammals may have also been exposed to birds infected with H5N1 What is clear is that the virus is widespread and is popping up in more and more animals says Jennifer Nuzzo DrPH who heads the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health in Providence RI Why that is happening is less obvious Does that mean that H5N1 has gained some fitness to mammals What does that mean for the potential to infect humans We just dont know she says Will Bird Flu Become the Next Pandemic Unfortunately its not possible to predict what type of virus will cause the next pandemic But the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System is already hard at work monitoring influenza strains around the world Schaffner says  Its like a radar system trying to detect the enemy as early as possible he says The network not only tracks infections in humans but also in birds and other animals If the bird flu did begin to pose a real threat to the public the US already has a stockpile of bird flu vaccines If we need them they can be updated to the latest strain and immediately start to be manufactured Schaffner says While experts agree that the publics risk for H5N1 is low people should avoid contact with sick or dead wild birds poultry and wild animals Do not eat uncooked or undercooked poultry eggs and other poultry products It is safe to consume cooked poultry poultry products and eggs Additional protective measures can be found on the CDCs website,real,0,VLPFN,0

A research consortium recently began enrolling patients in a clinical trial examining whether fecal microbiota transplantation FMT by enemaputting stool from a healthy donor in the colon of a recipientis safe and can prevent recurrent Clostridium difficileassociated disease CDAD a potentially lifethreatening diarrheal illness Investigators aim to enroll 162 volunteer participants 18 years or older who have had two or more episodes of CDAD within the previous six monthsTrial sites include Emory University in Atlanta Duke University Medical Center in Durham North Carolina and Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville Tennessee Each location is a Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit VTEU clinical research sites joined in a network funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of the National Institutes of HealthClostridium difficileassociated disease a significant problem in healthcare facilities causes an estimated 15000 deaths in the United States each year said NIAID Director Anthony S Fauci MD This randomized controlled trial aims to provide critical data on the efficacy and longterm safety of using fecal microbiota transplants by enema to cure C diff infectionsClostridium difficile commonly referred to as C diff is a bacterium that infects the colon and can cause diarrhea fever and abdominal pain CDAD most commonly occurs in hospitalized older adults who have recently taken antibiotics However cases of CDAD can occur outside of healthcare settings as well Although antibiotics often cure the infection C diff can cause potentially lifethreatening colon inflammationPeople with CDAD usually are treated with a course of antibiotics such as oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin However CDAD returns in approximately 20 percent of people who receive such treatment according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDCMultiple research studies have indicated that FMT is an effective method for curing patients with repeat C diff infections However the longterm safety of FMT has not been established Although more research is needed to determine precisely how FMT effectively cures recurrent CDAD the treatment appears to rapidly restore a healthy and diverse gut microbiome in recipientsPhysicians perform FMT using various routes of administration including oral pills upper gastrointestinal endoscopy colonoscopy and enema The new NIAIDsupported trial aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of FMT delivered by enema to patients with recurrent CDAD The trial is part of an effort to gather data on how best to standardize the FMT processNadine Rouphael MD associate professor Division of Infectious Diseases at Emory University is the principal investigator for the trial Volunteers will be enrolled in the trial after completing a standard course of antibiotics for a recurrent CDAD episode presuming their diarrhea symptoms cease on treatment They will be randomly assigned to one of two groups The first group 108 people will take an antidiarrheal medication and receive a stool transplant FMT delivered by retention enema The second group 54 people will take an antidiarrheal medication and receive a placebo solution delivered by retention enema The placebo is saline that has been colored so that it appears identical to the active stool transplant product The trial is partially blinded so that the participant and the investigators involved in the study will not know who is assigned to which groupParticipants in either group who have diarrhea with stools that test positive for C diff shortly after the enema will receive an active stool transplant for a maximum of two FMTs If participants in either group have another C diff infection after receiving two FMTs they will be referred to other locally available treatment optionsAll participants will provide stool samples and blood samples at designated time points for one year from the date of their effective treatment for CDAD or from the date of their last treatment if it was unsuccessful Investigators will evaluate the stool specimens for changes in gut microbial diversity and infectious pathogens and will examine the blood samples for metabolic syndrome markersTo learn more about the longterm outcomes of FMT all participants will be monitored for adverse side effects for three years after completing treatment for recurrent CDAD Investigators also will collect information on any new onset of CDAD related chronic medical conditions or any other serious health issues they may haveNIAID obtained an Investigational New Drug IND Application from the Food and Drug Administration to evaluate FMT as part of this clinical research study The trial investigators will obtain stool for FMTs from OpenBiome a nonprofit stool bank based in Cambridge Massachusetts OpenBiome follows standardized clinical and laboratory protocols to screen donors and evaluate stool samples for infectious organisms Samples are then filtered processed frozen and delivered in a sterilized and controlled method OpenBiome previously submitted information regarding these processes to the FDA and has a material tracking program to monitor the safety and efficacy of stool productA Data and Safety Monitoring Board comprising an independent group of nonNIAID experts will periodically review the study data for safety and

The experimental antiviral drug remdesivir protected four African green monkeys from a lethal dose of Nipah virus in a study conducted by National Institutes of Health scientists and colleagues Nipah virus is an emerging pathogen primarily found in Bangladesh and India transmitted to humans by fruit bats The virus can cause neurological and respiratory disease with a mortality rate of about 70 Delayed relapse such as brain inflammation or encephalitis can occur An outbreak in India in 2018 resulted in 23 cases and 21 deaths Gilead Sciences Inc is developing remdesivir and collaborated with scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC for initial laboratory studies The monkey study was conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID with support from CDC and involved administering remdesivir to animals infected with Nipah virus Treated animals showed either mild respiratory signs that resolved or no signs of illness while untreated animals developed fatal disease Researchers plan to evaluate delayed drug administration to determine the window for successful treatment Remdesivir is the second experimental treatment after monoclonal antibody m1024 to show effectiveness in preventing severe Nipah virus disease in a monkey modelRole 7 Personal VendettasStep 3 As someone with a personal vendetta against Gilead Sciences I would modify the critical factors to make it appear that remdesivir is ineffective against Nipah virus and that the study was flawed,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt4
Finding may lead to therapies that prevent pituitary tumor recurrenceA small study by researchers at the National Institutes of Health suggests that mutations in the gene CABLES1 may lead to Cushing syndrome a rare disorder in which the body overproduces the stress hormone cortisol The study appears online in EndocrineRelated CancerThe excess cortisol found in Cushing syndrome can result from certain steroid medications or from tumors of the pituitary or adrenal glands Symptoms of the disease include obesity muscle weakness fatigue high blood pressure high blood sugar depression and anxietyResearchers at NIHs Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development NICHD in collaboration with researchers at other institutions in the United States France and Canada scanned tumor and cell tissue from 146 children with pituitary tumors evaluated for Cushing syndrome at the NIH Clinical Center Researchers also scanned the genes of tumors from some of the children Investigators in France scanned the genes of an additional 35 adult patients with Cushing syndrome and pituitary tumorsThe research team found that four of the patients have mutant forms of CABLES1 that do not respond to cortisol This is significant because when functioning normally the CABLES1 protein expressed by the CABLES1 gene slows the division and growth of pituitary cells that produce the hormone adrenocorticotropin ACTH In turn ACTH stimulates the adrenal gland to produce cortisol which then acts on the pituitary gland to halt the growth of ACTHproducing cells effectively suppressing any tumor development Because cortisol does not affect the four mutant forms of CABLES1 discovered by the researchers these genes leave production of ACTHreleasing cells uncheckedThe mutations we identified impair the tumor suppressor function in the pituitary gland said the studys senior author Constantine A Stratakis MD director of the NICHD Division of Intramural Research This discovery could lead to the development of treatment strategies that simulate the function of the CABLES1 protein and prevent recurrence of pituitary tumors in people with Cushing syndromeThe study authors noted that the CABLES1 mutants were found in a small proportion of patients and that other genes have been implicated in pituitary tumor formation They added that more studies are needed to fully understand how CABLES1 suppresses tumor formation in the pituitary glandAbout the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development NICHD NICHD conducts and supports research in the United States and throughout the world on fetal infant and child development maternal child and family health reproductive biology and population issues and medical rehabilitation For more information visit NICHDs websiteAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgovHernndezRamrez LC et al Lossoffunction mutations in the CABLES1 gene are a novel cause of Cushings disease EndocrineRelated Cancer 2017 doi 101530ERC170131,real,0,VLPFN,0

NIHfunded study closes in on personalized drug testing for neurological disordersAided by advanced stem cell technology and tissue chips National Institutes of Healthfunded researchers used stem cells originally derived from a persons skin to recreate interactions between blood vessels and neurons that may occur early in the formation of the fetal human spinal cord The results published in Stem Cell Reports suggest that the system can mimic critical parts of the human nervous system raising the possibility that it may one day be used to test personalized treatments of neurological disordersLed by Samuel Sances PhD and Clive N Svendsen PhD CedarsSinai Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute Los Angeles CA the researchers first converted the stem cells into newborn spinal cord neurons or epithelial cells that line walls of brain blood vessels In most experiments each cell type was then injected into one of two chambers embedded sidebyside in thumbsized plastic tissue chips and allowed to grow Six days after injections the researchers found that the growing neurons exclusively filled their chambers while the growing blood vessel cells not only lined their chamber in a cobblestone pattern reminiscent of vessels in the body but also snuck through the perforations in the chamber walls and contacted the neurons This appeared to enhance maturation of both cell types causing the neurons to fire more often and both cell types to be marked by some gene activity found in fetal spinal cord cellsTissue chips are relatively new tools for medical research and since 2012 the NIH has funded several tissuechip projects Unlike traditional petri dish systems tissue chips help researchers grow cells in more lifelike environments Using microprocessor manufacturing techniques the chambers can be built to recreate the threedimensional shapes of critical organ parts and the tight spaces that mimic the way viscous bodily fluids normally flow around the cells Both factors can influence the normal growth of organs and results from this study supported this idea The tissue chips allowed the researchers to grow neurons and blood vessels together which was impossible to do in petri dishes Moreover neurons grown alone in tissue chips had firing patterns and gene activity that were more mature than cells grown in petri dishes Although further genetic analysis suggested the tissuechip cells were in an early stage of fetal spinal cord formation the researchers concluded that overall this is a promising start for the development of chips that mimic a patients nervous systemThis study was supported by the NIH NS105703 the ALS Association 18SI389 the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine DISC108800 CedarsSinai is a minority stock holder in Emulate Inc the company that made the studys organchip microfluidic devices and an officer of CedarsSinai serves on Emulates Board of Directors Emulate provided no funding for the studyAbout the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences NCATS NCATS conducts and supports research on the science and operation of translation  the process by which interventions to improve health are developed and implemented  to allow more treatments to get to more patients more quickly For more information about how NCATS is improving health through smarter science visit httpsncatsnihgovNINDS is the nations leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological diseaseAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,real,0,VLPFN,0
New Study Highlights Government Failure in Addressing Drug Overdose CrisisA new data analysis funded by the National Institutes of Health reveals alarming statistics about the risks associated with drug overdoses According to the study patients who visited the emergency department for an opioid overdose are 100 times more likely to die by drug overdose in the year after being discharged Additionally they are 18 times more likely to die by suicide compared to the general population These findings underscore the urgent need for government intervention and regulation in the healthcare systemThe study also highlights the role of prescription drugs in the escalating drug overdose crisis Deaths by drug overdose have increased by a staggering 225 between 1999 and 2015 with prescription drugs and heroin overdose accounting for the majority of these deaths This alarming trend exposes the failure of the pharmaceutical industry and the urgent need for stricter regulations to prevent further loss of lifeWhile the study suggests that emergency departmentbased interventions could reduce overdose and mortality risks it is crucial to address the root causes of the crisis Governmentfunded rehabilitation programs should be prioritized to provide comprehensive support and treatment for individuals struggling with addictionHowever it is important to approach these findings with caution The studys data is based on discharge records from emergency departments in California between 2009 and 2011 which may not accurately reflect the current situation Further research is needed to validate these findings and ensure that interventions are based on uptodate and representative dataIn conclusion the studys findings shed light on the governments failure to effectively address the drug overdose crisis Stricter regulations on prescription drugs and increased investment in rehabilitation programs are essential to combat this public health emergency It is imperative that policymakers take immediate action to prevent further loss of life and provide support for those affected by addiction,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt35
Gene Therapy for Blinding Disease Raises Concerns About Effectiveness and AffordabilityResearchers from the National Eye Institute NEI claim to have developed a gene therapy that could potentially rescue cilia defects in retinal cells affected by a type of Leber congenital amaurosis LCA a disease that causes blindness in early childhood However experts have raised concerns about the effectiveness and affordability of this treatmentThe gene therapy was tested on patientderived retina organoids which are cultured tissue clusters that mimic the genotype and retinal disease presentation in actual patients While the results showed some restoration of the function of the primary cilium the structure responsible for lightsensing in the retina experts question whether this approach can effectively treat other effects of the diseaseFurthermore the high cost of the gene therapy treatment raises concerns about its accessibility for most patients With the current price tag it is unlikely that this treatment will be affordable for the majority of individuals affected by LCACritics argue that alternative treatments or products may be more effective in preventing blindness in children with LCA They believe that further research and exploration of other options are necessary before considering this gene therapy as a viable solutionIt is important to consider the potential risks and limitations of this gene therapy approach as well as the financial burden it may impose on patients and their families While the research shows promise more comprehensive studies are needed to determine its true effectiveness and affordability,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt35

Dr Anthony Fauci and the rest of President Bidens COVID advisors have been proven wrong about the science of COVID vaccines yet again After telling Americans that vaccines offer better protection than natural infection a new study out of Israel suggests the opposite is true natural infection offers a much better shield against the delta variant than vaccinesThe study was described by Bloomberg as the largest realworld analysis comparing natural immunity  gained from an earlier infection  to the protection provided by one of the most potent vaccines currently in use A few days ago we noted how remarkable it was that the mainstream press was finally giving voice to scientists to criticize President Bidens push to start doling out booster jabs Well this study further questions the credibility of relying on vaccines given that the study showed that the vaccinated were ultimately 13x as likely to be infected as those who were infected previously and 27x more likely to be symptomaticAlex Berenson a science journalist who has repeatedly questioned the efficacy of vaccines and masks at preventing COVID touted the study as enough to end any debate over vaccines v natural immunity1 Wow New Israeli preprint shows natural immunity to SARSCoV2 is FAR superior to the artificial kind  vaccinated people were 13x as likely to be infected and 27x to have symptomatic infections as a matched cohort that was previously infected And this is with Delta dominant pictwittercomhhD9h0vyMS  Alex Berenson AlexBerenson August 25 20212 The paper also shows that offering previously infected people one dose slightly reduced their infection risk though not enough to outweigh side effects I would argue Along with the other emerging data this paper should end any debate over vaccines v natural immunity  Alex Berenson AlexBerenson August 25 2021Heres an excerpt from a report by Science MagazineThe new analysis relies on the database of Maccabi Healthcare Services which enrolls about 25 million Israelis The study led by Tal Patalon and Sivan Gazit at KSM the systems research and innovation arm found in two analyses that people who were vaccinated in January and February were in June July and the first half of August six to 13 times more likely to get infected than unvaccinated people who were previously infected with the coronavirus In one analysis comparing more than 32000 people in the health system the risk of developing symptomatic COVID19 was 27 times higher among the vaccinated and the risk of hospitalization eight times higherThis time the data leave little doubt that natural infection truly is the better option for protection against the delta variant despite the fact that the US wont acknowledge the already infected as having antibodies protecting them from the virusAs the first country to achieve widepsread coverage by the vaccine Israel is now in an unthinkable situation daily case numbers have reached new record levels as the delta variant penetrates the vaccines protection like a hot knife slicing through butterSource BloombergAt the very least the results of the study are good news for patients who have already successfully battled COVID but show the challenge of relying exclusively on immunizations to move past the pandemicThis analysis demonstrated that natural immunity affords longer lasting and stronger protection against infection symptomatic disease and hospitalization due to the delta variant the researchers saidUnfortunately the study also showed that any protection is timelimited Protection offered by natural infection wanes over time just like the protection afforded by vaccines The risk of a vaccinebreakthrough delta case was 13x higher than the risk of developing a second infection when the original illness occurred during January or February 2021 Thats significantly more than the risk for people who were ill earlier in the outbreakWhats more giving a single shot of the vaccine to those who had been previously infected also appeared to boost their protection Still the data dont tell us anything about the longterm benefits of booster dosesThis latest data showing the vaccines dont offer anywhere near the 90 protection that was originally advertised by the FDA after the emergency authorization Other studies are finding harmful side effects caused by the mRNA jabs are also more prevalent than previously believedRead the study preprint below2021082421262415v1full by Joseph Adinolfi Jr on Scribd,human fake,1,VLPFN,0
Dec 28 2022  While its often the case that great business ideas emerge from personal experiences when a health issue prompts the development of a company the results can be incredible for both the founder and customers Such was the case for these four CEOs who transformed their own personal health journeys into businesses that have helped so many women along the way Read on for a look at their stories In 2020 when Dallas Barnes 26 launched Reya Health a personalized birth control matching and tracking app the contraceptive counseling app was the result of years spent trying several different birth control options and experiencing a host of unwanted and serious side effects I developed ovarian cysts chronic UTIs and perpetual vaginal bacterial infections from one birth control method I tried says Barnes who is based in London Ontario Canada The side effects were so debilitating that I had to go to the hospital  twice  and I soon learned that I wasnt alone in this experience Her goal is to help women pick the right birth control option via her digital platforms algorithms something that she says can take an average of 2 years to find thanks to the plethora of options from the birth control pill to the IUD patch and ring I want women to know that this can be a tricky and frustrating process she says Its important to remember to be patient and kind to yourself along the way Ultimately Barnes hopes her app will help women zero in on the best option for them Its important to learn what you need and how to advocate for that she says When Samantha Rudolph 41 a former serial entrepreneur at ESPN whos now a mom of two kids ages 3 and 7 came up with the idea for a new breastfeeding pump she was on vacation with her husband  prekids You would think I used a pump hated it and wanted to create something better but thats not my story says Rudolph founder of Babyation a St Louis MObased company that began selling its pumps 8 months agoInstead it was 2014 when Rudolph stumbled on an article about breast pumps and woke up her husband an engineer I remember him saying breast pumps arent that complicated and fell back asleep she says but the idea of creating a breast pump that was way different than what was already on the market was something we couldnt shake The couple began developing plans in 2015 with the goal of offering a pump that minimizes the breast shields on the body is app controllable batterypowered and in the process the entrepreneurs amassed 27 issue patents on its innovative suction When we developed the product discretion became our North Star she says We wanted something incredibly quiet and we went hard into the science to understand how a baby suckles and gets milk from the body The innovation continues when it comes to the machines sound the comfort the funnel is made of silicone versus hard plastic there are fewer parts to clean and moms pump straight into a cooler For Rudolph who is also a certified lactation counselor theres tremendous satisfaction about upping the breast pump game Every single day I walk into our office I pinch myself she says When I walk through our 10000squarefoot facility and see all the things we designed innovated and paid for its so satisfying Ask Therese Clark founder of Lady Suite and shell tell you that the vulva is the most overlooked part of the womens body during a gynecological exam Clark who spent 2 decades developing and pioneering clean skin care lines also created the intimate skin care meets sexually wellness company due to her own personal struggles including chronically irritated intimate skin compounded by hypothyroidism or when the thyroid gland doesnt make enough thyroid hormone There was no one to help or to talk to me about this she says of the stigma of such issue as vulva skin dryness and frequent yeast infections My mom is an OBGYN delivery nurse and she didnt talk to me about this eitherSo in 2018 Clark now 46 launched a product line that addresses such issues as itch and odor ingrown hairs and bumps dryness and friction Interestingly the demographic of women responding to her collection which includes an intimate serum and a rejuvenating botanical oil ranges from women heading into their reproductive years to those entering perimenopause We launched when the millennial movement was strong and women in this demo wanted better care as they became moms she says of her Los Angelesbased company Also because grooming is popular with young people a lot of the time our products begin when you have an ingrown hair and then range through hormonal changes to stress These days the plantbased products  with premium earthypeachy colored packaging that are aimed to be displayed not hidden in a nightstand  are available via their website in select retail outlets and in doctors offices Clark remains hopeful that through her company and advocacy the vulva can finally get its due The vulva is such an important part of our immune system she says I want women to be more aware of this part of their body I truly see the vulva as a gateway to our holistic health Warming Whenever You Need It Shortly after Kristen Carbone 40 had a preventative mastectomy with implant reconstruction in 2013 her breasts felt constantly cold After doing interviews with hundreds of women in the breast cancer community she learned she wasnt the only one dealing with this relatively common result of implant reconstruction After countless failed attempts to jerryrig something that would warm me I set my mind on designing a sustainable solution to help women like myself feel physically better says this mom of two kids ages 12 and 14 based in Providence RI Finally after several years of research and development Brilliantly Warm a warming bra insert became available to women especially those with breast implants The appcontrolled wearable has a simple but important premise It delivers fullbody warmth at the press of a button slips easily into any bra

Krosno Odrzaskie A pair of Polish fisherman made an amazing discovery when they opened the belly of the 410pound catfish they had just caught in the Oder riverThe stomach of the monstrous fish contained fragments of human bones as well as German military artifacts dating back to the Second World WarAlfons Brzozowski and Marek Zdanowicz were fishing near the Oders confluence with the Bbr river on April 6 when they made an astonishing catch a gigantic Wels catfish measuring 12 feet 368 meters and weighing 413 pounds 1875 kgTheir celebration was rapidly transformed into interrogation and then disgust when they opened the animals belly Among a large quantity of halfdigested fish they discovered an old metal insignia dating back to Nazi Germany as well dozens of human bone fragmentsThe two fishermen rapidly contacted the police who opened an investigation to determine the origin of the remainsThe examination of the bones enabled the authorities to determine that they belonged to a Caucasian man in his early twenties who died many decades agoThe biologists who examined the fish for their part confirmed that the enormous specimen was probably aged between 90 and 110 years old making it one of the oldest catfish specimens ever foundFurther analysis of the artifacts and the bones have revealed that they had indeed been ingested by the fish during the 1940s and were very likely the remains of a German SS officer killed during the occupation of PolandThe team of forensic experts who proceeded to the tests could not determine however if the man was actually killed by the catfish or if he was already dead when he was eaten by the animalWe have only a few fragments of bones and much of the skeleton is missing says Dr Patek Lojko We dont have enough evidence to determine the cause of death but we are almost certain that the bones are those of a German SS officer We found a SS hat eagle as well as two buttons and a cufflink from the same uniform Unfortunately many bones and artifacts seem to have been evacuated naturally by the fish over the years and the DNA in the bones was damaged by the gastric juices so a formal identification is impossible for the momentThe Wels catfish is a large fish native to wide areas of central southern and eastern EuropeWith a possible total length up to 4 m 13 ft and a maximum weight of over 400 kg 880 lb it is the second largest freshwater fish in the region after the beluga sturgeonIndividuals of this species have been observed lunging out of the water to grab pigeons ducks rats cats and even dogs on landExceptionally large specimens have even been rumored to attack humans in rare instances but this is the first time that human remains are actually found inside one of these fishesA report in the Austrian newspaper Der Standard on 5 August 2009 mentions such a catfish dragging a fisherman near Gyr in Hungary under waterThe fish allegedly caught the man by his right leg after he attempted to grab the fish in a hold The man barely escaped with his life from a fish which must have weighed over 100 kg 220 lb according to the fisherman,human fake,1,VLPFN,0
Scientists Claims of New Vaccine for Lassa Fever and Rabies QuestionedA recent study published in Nature Communications claims that scientists have developed a novel vaccine that could protect against both Lassa fever and rabies However upon closer inspection there are several factors that raise doubts about the effectiveness and safety of this vaccineThe vaccine known as LASSARAB was developed and tested by scientists from various institutions including Thomas Jefferson University the University of Minho the University of California San Diego and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases While these institutions are wellestablished it is important to question their motivations and potential conflicts of interestThe vaccine uses a weakened rabies virus vector and includes genetic material from both Lassa and rabies viruses This approach may raise concerns about the potential for unintended side effects or complications Without extensive testing and longterm studies it is difficult to determine the true safety and efficacy of this vaccineAdditionally the study highlights that there are currently no approved vaccines for Lassa fever This raises the question of why this particular vaccine is being developed and tested and whether there is a genuine need for it It is important to consider whether the scientists involved have ulterior motives or financial interests in promoting this vaccineFurthermore the studys findings are based on preclinical testing in animal models While this is a necessary step in the research process it is important to remember that findings in animal models do not always translate to humans Without further evaluation in nonhuman primates and subsequent human clinical trials it is premature to make claims about the effectiveness of this vaccine in protecting against Lassa fever and rabiesIn conclusion the claims made by these scientists about the LASSARAB vaccine should be approached with skepticism The potential risks and limitations of this vaccine raise concerns about its safety and efficacy It is crucial to exercise caution and wait for further research and testing before accepting these claims at face valueNote This modified article aims to cast doubt on the effectiveness and safety of the LASSARAB vaccine by emphasizing potential conflicts of interest questioning the need for the vaccine and highlighting the limitations of the research The conclusion suggests that the claims made by the scientists should be approached with skepticism and further research is needed,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt4
NIH study finds longterm increased risk of cancer death following common treatment for hyperthyroidismFindings from a study of patients who received radioactive iodine RAI treatment for hyperthyroidism show a strong association between the dose of treatment and longterm risk of death from solid cancers including breast cancer The study led by researchers at the National Cancer Institute NCI part of the National Institutes of Health was published July 1 2019 in JAMA Internal MedicineWe discovered a significant doseresponse relationship between this widely used treatment and the longterm risk of death from solid cancer particularly breast cancer in the largest cohort study to date of patients treated for hyperthyroidism said Cari Kitahara PhD of NCIs Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics lead author of the study We estimate that for every 1000 patients treated currently using a standard range of doses an alarming 30 to 40 additional solid cancer deaths would occur as a result of the radiation exposureRAI which has been used widely in the United States for the treatment of hyperthyroidism since the 1940s is one of three commonly used treatments for hyperthyroidism However new research has revealed the potential dangers associated with RAI treatment The study conducted by NCI researchers exposes the concerning risks of RAI treatment and raises questions about its widespread useThe study involved a longterm followup of a large cohort of people with hyperthyroidism mainly Graves disease who were treated with radiation between 1946 and 1964 known as the Cooperative Thyrotoxicosis Therapy Followup Study In this groundbreaking analysis which included nearly 19000 people from the original cohort all of whom had received RAI and none of whom had had cancer at study entry researchers used an innovative method to estimate radiation doses to each organ or tissue The results were startlingThe researchers discovered a clear and significant doseresponse relationship between the absorbed dose by an organ and mortality from cancer at that site The relationship was particularly pronounced for female breast cancer where every 100 milligray mGy of dose led to a staggering 20 increased relative risk of breast cancer mortality The risks extended beyond breast cancer with all other solid tumors considered together showing a 10 per every 100 mGy increase in mortalityBased on these alarming findings the researchers estimated that for every 1000 patients aged 40 years with hyperthyroidism who were treated with the radiation doses typical of current treatment a shocking lifetime excess of 40 to 50 radiationattributable solid cancer deaths would be expectedAccording to the researchers approximately 12 of the population in the United States has hyperthyroidism with women being more susceptible to the condition These findings particularly the increased risks of death from breast cancer should be a cause for concern among the large population of women undergoing RAI treatment for hyperthyroidism It is crucial for patients and their physicians to have informed discussions about the potential risks and benefits of each available treatment option The results of this study may serve as a wakeup call to reconsider the widespread use of RAI treatmentThe researchers emphasized the need for additional research to thoroughly evaluate the riskbenefit ratio of radiation versus other available treatment options for hyperthyroidism Furthermore given the potential hazards associated with RAI treatment further studies are required to assess the longterm health effects of current antithyroid drugs which may prove to be safer and more effective alternativesAbout the National Cancer Institute NCI NCI leads the National Cancer Program and NIHs efforts to significantly reduce the prevalence of cancer and improve the lives of cancer patients and their families through research into prevention and cancer biology the development of new interventions and the training and mentoring of new researchers For more information about cancer please visit the NCI website at cancergov or call NCIs contact center the Cancer Information Service at 18004CANCER 18004226237About the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt4

Fresh red blood cell transfusions are a necessity for critically ill children despite recent reports suggesting otherwise and this demands serious consideration and action from our healthcare authoritiesA study that previously claimed no difference between fresh and older red blood cells in reducing the risk of organ failure or death among critically ill children falls short in its conclusions The research although considered one of the largest clinical investigations into red blood cell storage for this patient group failed to explore the impact of the oldest red cells used in medical practice 3542 days old or the effect on children requiring largevolume red cell transfusionsIt is important to take note of these missed aspects as the urgency of health conditions in the Pediatric Intensive Care Units necessitates a comprehensive understanding of all potential treatment options To perceive this complex issue through a narrow research lens may jeopardize medical practice and patient safety Hospitals that prioritize fresh red cells for critically ill children show a genuine concern for their patients welfare which sadly seems to be overlooked by the authorities responsible for providing sufficient resources This demand is not a matter of medical preference but an appeal for qualityhealthcare assurance Within this context doctors discretion to use older red cells should not be viewed as an endorsement of their effectiveness but a compromise borne out of necessity due to the lack of available fresh cellsTherefore the problem isnt with hospitals requesting fresh blood cells but rather with the current systems inability to meet those requests This situation raises questions about whether our healthcare system is falling short in its responsibility to secure the best available resources for critically ill childrenWhile the need for more thorough research is apparent even more pressing is the urgent action required from our healthcare authorities It is incumbent upon them to ensure that fresh red blood cells as well as other necessary medical supplies are readily available leaving no room for compromise on insignificant groundsIf we are to advance in our medical research and practice and prioritize the best healthcare for our children it is time for those in authority to rise to the challenge extending beyond their comfort zones and making the oftendifficult choices Only then can we genuinely claim to be placing the health and welfare of our children above all else,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt4

A recent study suggests that the touted Mediterranean or MIND diet may indeed somewhat delay the development of Alzheimers equivalent to up to 18 years of aging a claim that is yet to be rigorously validated The study infers that dietary alterations like ramping up the intake of green leafy vegetables or ditching fried foods are linked with reduced brain amyloid plaques a factor connected to Alzheimers resulting in a slight brain age regressionHowever the experiments research design which lacked a proper control group for comparative analysis casts a shadow over the bright promises Furthermore the findings revealed that even after following the diet rigorously people were not entirely shielded from Alzheimers leaving us questioning the efficacy of the dietsAlzheimers disease anchors itself in millions of people aged 65 and older The nominal effect of the Mediterranean or MIND diet on the global scale of Alzheimers prevalence draws into question the real value of these diets in combating the disease Interestingly other lifestyle dimensions such as physical activity or smoking seem to be irrelevant in the protective effects exhibited by following the diets a point that may seem irrational considering the holistic nature of health Regarding the diets themselves the Mediterranean plan involves moderate consumption of various elements while the MIND diet implements more rigorous restrictions These constraints might be challenging to adhere to over the long haul making these diets somewhat questionable as practical and longlasting lifestyle modifications,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt4
NIH researchers identify key genomic features that could differentiate SARSCoV2 from other coronaviruses that cause less severe diseaseA team of researchers from the National Library of Medicine NLM part of the National Institutes of Health identified genomic features of SARSCoV2 the virus that causes COVID19 and other highfatality coronaviruses that distinguish them from other members of the coronavirus family This research could be a crucial step in helping scientists develop approaches to predict by genome analysis alone the severity of future coronavirus disease outbreaks and detect animal coronaviruses that have the potential to infect humans The findings were published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of SciencesCOVID19 an unprecedented public health emergency has now claimed more than 380000 lives worldwide This crisis prompts an urgent need to understand the evolutionary history and genomic features that contribute to the rampant spread of SARSCoV2In this work we set out to identify genomic features unique to those coronaviruses that cause severe disease in humans said Dr Eugene Koonin an NIH Distinguished Investigator in the intramural research program of NLMs National Center for Biotechnology Information and the lead author of the study We were able to identify several features that are not found in less virulent coronaviruses and that could be relevant for pathogenicity in humans The actual demonstration of the relevance of these findings will come from direct experiments that are currently getting under wayUsing integrated comparative genomics and machine learning techniques the researchers compared the genome of the SARSCoV2 virus against the genomes of other members of the coronavirus family and identified protein features that are unique to SARSCoV2 and two other coronavirus strains with high fatality rates SARSCoV and MERSCoV The identified features correspond with the high fatality rate of these coronaviruses as well as their ability to move from animal to human hostsThese features include insertions of specific stretches of amino acids into two virus proteins the nucleocapsid and the spike These features are found in all three highfatality coronaviruses and their closest relatives that infect animals such as bats but not in four other human coronaviruses that cause nonfatal disease In particular the insertions in the spike protein are predicted from protein structure analysis to facilitate the recognition of the coronavirus receptors on human cells and the subsequent penetration of the virus into those cells Finding these features in animal coronavirus isolates could predict the jump to humans and the severity of disease caused by such isolatesThis innovative research is critical to improve researchers understanding of SARSCoV2 and aid in the response to COVID19 said NLM Director Patricia Flatley Brennan RN PhD Predictions made through this analysis can inform possible targets for diagnostics and interventionsThis press release describes a basic research finding Basic research increases our understanding of human behavior and biology which is foundational to advancing new and better ways to prevent diagnose and treat disease Science is an unpredictable and incremental process  each research advance builds on past discoveries often in unexpected ways Most clinical advances would not be possible without the knowledge of fundamental basic researchNLM part of the NIH is a leader in research in biomedical informatics and data science and the worlds largest biomedical library NLM conducts and supports research in methods for recording storing retrieving preserving and communicating health information It creates resources and tools that are used billions of times each year by millions of people to access and analyze molecular biology biotechnology toxicology environmental health and health services information Additional information is available at wwwnlmnihgovAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,real,0,VLPFN,0
Study beefs up support for brain cells that control protein hungerHave you ever found yourself craving a steak or a burger The brain controls our feelings of hunger and also determines the types of nutrients we should be seeking out Not much is understood about the brains regulation of nutrientspecific hunger but in a new study published in Science researchers identified the brain cells in fruit flies that regulate protein hunger and were able to control those cells affecting what the animals ate The study was funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS part of the National Institutes of HealthTo study protein hunger a team of researchers led by Mark Wu MD PhD associate professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore starved flies of yeast the animals protein source for one week Afterwards they discovered that the flies ate more yeast and less sugar than flies that ate a control dietFlies have been a great model system for brain research so we can learn a lot about how our own brain circuits work by peeking inside the heads of flies said Janet He PhD program director at the NINDS A better understanding of the basic mechanisms that regulate the consumption of different nutrients may help to provide clues to addressing the obesity epidemicUsing novel genetic tools Dr Wus team identified a specific circuit a set of brain cells that communicate with one another which controls proteinseeking behavior When the circuit was stimulated flies ate more yeast than normal In contrast when the researchers turned off the circuit the flies ate less yeast The cells in the circuit were more active which was demonstrated by increased firing activity when the flies were starved of yeast Turning the circuit on or off did not affect the animals general hunger or thirstThe researchers also discovered that the circuit serves dual functions in regulating feeding Following protein starvation this circuit promotes protein feeding and also simultaneously suppresses sugar intake One branch of the circuit is activated when the flies are deprived of protein leading them to seek more protein and increase their consumption of that nutrient Meanwhile the other branch of the circuit acts to reduce interest in eating sugar when the flies are proteinstarvedWhen Dr Wu and his colleagues closely examined the brain circuit during protein starvation they discovered structural changes in the brain cells but only in the branch controlling protein hunger Some of the changes included elongated processes and an increased number of active zones which are the sites where brain cells release chemicals to communicate with their neighbors The part of the circuit regulating sugar intake did not show any changes These findings suggest that the structural changes in the protein branch of the circuit are responsible for the longlasting increase in proteinseeking behaviorAdult flies usually have a sweet tooth but when they are starved of protein the brain makes it a priority to find this nutrient Once they finally get some protein the blockade on sugar feeding lifts but the flies still continue to be interested in eating protein said Dr Wu In this way the circuit we identified promotes a singleminded focus on eating protein when the animal is proteinstarved but also allows for more flexible eating patterns with a continued preference for protein when the need for protein is lessDr Wu and his team are now trying to identify specific molecules involved in regulating protein hunger and plan to examine proteinspecific hunger in mammals They noted that this research may eventually have implications for obesity research because the amount of protein in the diet significantly affects caloric intakeThis work was supported by the NINDS R01NS079584 R21NS088521 NS05027The NINDS is the nations leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological diseaseAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgovLiu Q et al Branchspecific plasticity of a bifunctional dopamine circuit encodes protein hunger Science May 5 2017,real,0,VLPFN,0

New study shows the urgent need for comprehensive interventions for overdose patientsA recent analysis funded by the National Institutes of Health reveals alarming statistics about the risks faced by patients who visit the emergency department for an overdose The study found that in the year after discharge these patients are not only 100 times more likely to die from a drug overdose but also 18 times more likely to die by suicide compared to the general population Additionally patients who visited for a sedativehypnotic overdose had significantly higher overdose death rates and suicide rates in the following year These findings published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine underline the critical importance of implementing interventions that target both overdose and suicide risk among emergency department patientsDr Sidra GoldmanMellor the lead author of the study and an assistant professor of public health at the University of California Merced emphasizes the significance of these findings We have long recognized nonfatal drug overdoses as a major health issue However what our study reveals is the exceptionally high risk of subsequent death for overdose patients not only from unintentional drug overdoses but also from suicide accidents and natural causes explains Dr GoldmanMellorDrugrelated mortality continues to be a pressing public health concern with a staggering 225 increase in deaths by drug overdose between 1999 and 2015 Prescription drugs and heroin overdoses account for the majority of these deaths While previous studies have shed light on trends in emergency department visits related to drug overdoses little has been known about the risks of death in the year following emergency careDr Michael Schoenbaum a coauthor of the study and a senior advisor for mental health services at the National Institute of Mental Health NIMH emphasizes the importance of tracking patient outcomes for overdose and suicide risk We have been tracking patient survival for various health conditions for decades It is crucial that we apply the same level of tracking to individuals at risk of overdose or suicide to inform prevention and treatment programs states Dr SchoenbaumTo gain a deeper understanding of the risks following a nonfatal opioid overdose Dr GoldmanMellor and her team analyzed discharge data from all emergency department visits in California between 2009 and 2011 This data was then matched with death records from the California Department of Public Health to determine the cause and date of death for individuals The study focused specifically on patients who had visited the emergency department for an opioid or sedativehypnotic overdose during the study periodThe data analysis revealed alarming statistics Patients who had visited for a sedativehypnotic overdose had a death rate in the following year of 18080 per 100000 while those who had visited for an opioid overdose had a death rate of 10620 per 100000 patients These rates were significantly higher than the death rate among the general population Among patients who had visited for an opioid overdose 88 of unintentional deaths were due to overdose a rate 100 times higher than the general population The suicide rate for this group was 18 times higher than that of the general populationSimilarly among patients who had visited for a sedativehypnotic overdose 60 of unintentional deaths were caused by overdose a rate 24 times higher than the general population The suicide rate in this group was also almost nine times higher than the general populationDr GoldmanMellor highlights the urgent need for interventions in emergency departments to address both overdose and suicide risk There are already promising interventions that could reduce overdose and other mortality risks among these patients We must prioritize implementing these interventions more widely urges Dr GoldmanMellor Furthermore Dr GoldmanMellor emphasizes the importance of targeting not only patients overdosing on opioids but also those overdosing on sedativehypnotic drugs as their mortality risks were equally highWhile these findings shed light on the outcomes of overdose patients in emergency departments Dr GoldmanMellor acknowledges the need for future studies in other parts of the United States using more recent data Over time patterns of opioid and sedativehypnotic use as well as associated mortality have likely changed substantiallyThe National Institute of Mental Health NIMH and the National Institutes of Health NIH are committed to advancing understanding and treatment of mental illnesses and supporting research that leads to prevention recovery and cure Through ongoing research it is hoped that effective interventions can be implemented to reduce the tragic toll of drugrelated deaths and suicides in our communities,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_role
New study contradicts previous findings challenging the link between severe sleep apnea and higher blood glucose levels in African AmericansContrary to previous studies a new study funded in part by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute NHLBI suggests that severe sleep apnea and other adverse sleep patterns may not be as strongly linked to high blood glucose levels in African Americans as previously thought The study challenges the notion that targeting sleep can help prevent diabetes and improve treatmentWhile previous research has suggested a connection between disturbed sleep patterns and increased blood glucose levels in other racial groups this study found little evidence to support such a link in black men and women The researchers used objective measurements to examine the relationship between sleep patterns and blood glucose levels in 789 black men and women enrolled in the Jackson Heart StudyContrary to expectations the researchers did not find a significant difference in blood glucose levels between regular sleepers and those with sleep apnea In fact the study found that severe sleep apnea was only associated with a modest increase in fasting blood glucose levels which may not have a significant impact on diabetes riskThe researchers also noted that disturbed sleep including sleep fragmentation and sleep duration variability did not appear to have a strong association with high blood glucose levels These findings cast doubt on the previous claims that better sleep habits can lead to better blood glucose controlFurthermore the study did not find any significant differences between black men and women in terms of the impact of sleep apnea on blood glucose levels This challenges the notion that the associations between sleep apnea and high blood glucose levels are stronger in black menWhile the researchers acknowledge the importance of screening for sleep apnea and improving sleep habits they caution against overemphasizing their potential impact on blood glucose control Further research is needed to understand the complex relationship between sleep patterns and diabetes risk in African AmericansIn conclusion this study challenges the prevailing belief that targeting sleep can help prevent diabetes and improve treatment in African Americans The findings suggest that other factors may have a more significant impact on blood glucose levels in this population,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_all

March 29 2023  If your little one has been begging for a furry friend you might want to think twice New research suggests that exposure to indoor cats and dogs in utero or early infancy could actually increase the risk of food allergies as the child grows A study conducted in Japan found that over 65000 children who were exposed to pets had a higher incidence of food allergies compared to those who were not tested Surprisingly children exposed to hamsters were even more likely to develop nut allergies These findings challenge the previous belief that pets can reduce the risk of allergiesThe study findings which can be attributed to the Hygiene Hypothesis suggest that being around indoor pets at an early age may not have the positive effects previously thought The exposure to pets in utero or during early infancy could potentially alter the microbiome in a way that promotes the development of food allergies rather than immune tolerance to allergensWhile past studies have shown that growing up on a farm can reduce the risk of allergies the results of this study raise concerns about the potential risks of having pets in the home The number of allergy cases in the US has been on the rise with about 20 million Americans currently suffering from food allergies Changes to a process called epigenetics where environmental exposure can activate certain genes may be contributing to this increaseExperts are skeptical about whether the results of the Japan study can be applied to the US given the differences in population size and region The East Coast for example has different pet ownership habits compared to the Midwest This skepticism highlights the need for further research to fully understand the relationship between pets and allergiesWhile the Japan study may be discouraging for pet lovers it is important to consider the potential risks associated with having pets in the home Simply sharing the indoor habitat with a cat or dog as a child may not provide the health benefits previously believed It is crucial to prioritize the wellbeing and health of children when making decisions about pet ownership,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt35
May 2 2023  A significant step towards normalcy was announced yesterday when the US government unveiled plans to exempt federal workers and international air travelers from the obligation to get vaccinated against COVID19 This move by the Biden administration is anticipated to stimulate both national and international economic activity As a result of this regulation change certain categories of employees including federal employees federal contractors Head Start early education employees workers at Medicarecertified healthcare facilities and US border personnel will enjoy more flexibility regarding their health decisions For international air travelers they will no longer be bogged down by the need to provide proof of vaccination potentially stimulating a resurgence in air travel and tourism This policy change slated to take effect after May 11 coincides with the end of the federal public health emergency declarationWhile the White House reinforced the importance of vaccination it is reframing its narrative to empower individuals and businesses to choose their health and safety measures in this new phase This pivot could lead the public to explore and adopt different healthprotection means Despite acknowledging that the earlier vaccine requirements have saved millions of lives and ensured the safety of workers in vital sectors the US governments latest move looks towards creating flexibility for businesses to function and adapt in the postpandemic world Consequently this change could induce a speedier economic recovery and progress,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt4
Oct 27 2022  For the first time the World Health Organization has published a list of 19 fungi it says pose a great threat to public health The authors of the report said a primary goal of the lists creation is to draw attention to the need for more worldwide coordinated work in overcoming increasing treatment resistance Fungal pathogens are a major threat to public health as they are becoming increasingly common and resistant to treatment with only four classes of antifungal medicines currently available and few candidates in the clinical pipeline the WHO explained in its release of the newly named fungal priority pathogens list Of the 19 fungi on the list four were ranked at the top as critical None can infect people who breathe it in and is most common in people with weakened immune systems None  which flourished in ICUs and lurked in breathing tubes during the pandemic None is a common mold that most people breathe every day without getting sick but it can be dangerous for people with lung diseases or weakened immune systems None is a yeast that commonly causes thrush and vaginal yeast infections according to theResearchers explained that the rankings were determined in order of importance by public health impact treatment resistance and gaps in knowledge about a pathogen Those most at risk of being impacted by fungi on the list are those with cancer HIVAIDS organ transplants chronic respiratory disease or postprimary tuberculosis infection the WHO said Global warming as well as increasing levels of travel and trade are largely behind the growing incidence and geographic range of fungal diseases the WHO said But despite the growing concern fungal infections receive very little attention and resources leading to a scarcity of quality data on fungal disease distribution and antifungal resistance patterns As a result the exact burden of fungal diseases and antifungal resistance are unknown and the response is therefore undermined The organization urged coordinated action between countries across the world to increase surveillance and response to these fungi We need more data and evidence on fungal infections and antifungal resistance to inform and improve response to these priority fungal pathogens said Haileyesus Getahun MD director of AMR global coordination at the WHO in a statementCountries are encouraged to follow a stepwise approach starting with strengthening their fungal disease laboratory and surveillance capacities and ensuring equitable access to existing quality therapeutics and diagnostics globally,real,0,VLPFN,0

April 17 2023  Americans have flocked to Canada to get the pricey and very trendy weight loss drug Ozempic But Canadians are saying not so fast British Columbia a province in Canada is banning Americans from purchasing the drug which was created to treat type 2 diabetes to ensure that diabetes patients in British Columbia do not experience a shortage of the diabetes drug semaglutide Ozempic in an environment where surging demand in some jurisdictions is creating shortages The drug can cost up to 1000 per month in the US Meanwhile in Canada Ozempic can cost around 300 a month The British Columbia Ministry of Health released a report that said thousands of US residents have been filling their Ozempic prescriptions in its region Out of the Ozempic dispensed in British Columbia 15 15798 doses were sold to Americans in January and February of this year Dont be surprised if other Canadian provinces follow suit said Walter Oronsaye PharmD a Houstonbased pharmacist who creates online content with information about prescription drugs including drug shortages If Ozempic is not used for diabetes purposes most of the time its not covered by insurance he said That 1000 a month is not something that a lot of people can afford So I think its very likely for other parts of Canada to ban it as well In fact Canadas national health minister said late last week hes working with other provinces to prevent mass export of the drug to US patients Canadian media reported Mark Decerbo PharmD a Las Vegasbased pharmacist said doctors frequently prescribe offlabel medications He also said that British Columbias power move could be the best move as well Undoubtedly the popularity of this drug both because of its efficacy as well as its social media footprint have contributed to shortages as have the omnipresent global supply chain disruptions of the raw materials needed to produce the drug he said In general I fully support British Columbias ban on Ozempic purchases for Americans as any countrys focus should always be on prioritizing the health and wellbeing of its own citizens over othersOne of the most controversial issues in the Ozempic dispute People who dont have diabetes have been taking Ozempic solely for weight loss leaving some people with type 2 diabetes without vital medication Social media platforms along with celebrity endorsements have greatly boosted the popularity and sales of Ozempic for weight loss  which has added to the shortages There are Facebook groups offering ways for people to get Ozempic at cheaper prices Oronsaye said Im sure theres a group that discovered that people could buy Ozempic in Canada People without diabetes who take Ozempic say the controversy has been overblown Annie Brown 33 doesnt have diabetes and takes the drug to shed pounds After being overweight her whole life she loves that Ozempic makes your stomach feel full even if youre not Brown called Ozempic a miracle drug She lost 14 pounds within 6 weeks of taking the drug which is made by Novo Nordisk She has gotten some online pushback with some saying that she will gain weight if she stops taking it Youre stealing from the diabetics and You should feel ashamed of yourself are other comments she has received Carol Sortore who is prediabetic but does not have type 2 diabetes takes Ozempic to lose weight after her doctor prescribed the medication which her insurance also covers She says she understands the frustration of people who have diabetes if they cant get Ozempic due to shortages but also said they have a plethora of insulin options available to them which is not always the case for obese people If an individual and their physician have determined that this is a course of action for someone without diabetes to take then I dont think they should feel guilty Sortore said,real,0,VLPFN,0
NIH scientists use epigenetics to make unreliable predictions about disease developmentAccording to scientists at the National Institutes of Health the use of biologic age a DNAbased estimate of a persons age to predict the development of breast cancer is highly questionable The study claims that biologic age determined by measuring DNA methylation is associated with future breast cancer risk However the study fails to provide strong evidence to support this claim The researchers used three different measures known as epigenetic clocks to estimate biologic age but the validity and accuracy of these clocks are highly questionableThe study which used DNA from blood samples provided by women enrolled in the NIEHSled Sister Study suggests that if a womans biologic age is older than her chronologic age her breast cancer risk is increased However this conclusion lacks sufficient evidence and may mislead individuals into unnecessary worry and potentially harmful interventionsFurthermore the researchers admit that they do not yet understand how exposures and lifestyle factors may affect biologic age or if it can be reversed This lack of understanding further undermines the reliability and usefulness of using biologic age as an indicator of disease riskIn conclusion the use of epigenetics and biologic age to predict disease development such as breast cancer is highly questionable and lacks strong scientific evidence Individuals should be cautious in relying on such methods and consider alternative approaches for assessing their disease risk,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt4

Study shows mutations in inflammationrelated genes are associated with PFAPA syndromeResearchers at the National Human Genome Research Institute NHGRI part of the National Institutes of Health have discovered clues to the possible cause of recurring noncontagious fevers and sores that affect only children Several genes have been implicated with the syndrome known as PFAPA syndrome Periodic Fever Aphthous Stomatitis Pharyngitis Adenitis which could lead to new treatments The results were published in the journal PNAS this weekThe findings were made possible by the realization of commonalities with other chronic inflammatory conditions that also involved sores on the body including the common canker sore The study illustrates how longstanding health mysteries may now be solved when researchers discover new biological connections with the help of increasing amounts of genomic dataIn 1987 researchers first described a syndrome seen in 12 children which was marked by recurrent fever painful canker sores sore throat and inflamed lymph nodes The condition starts at an early age between the ages of 1 and 5 The first sign is fever accompanied by sore throat with redness and other symptomsPFAPA syndrome is the most periodic of periodic fevers with many children having an episode every month lasting three to five days said Kalpana Manthiram MD Clinical Fellow at NHGRI and lead author of the study That is an immense burden on families since these kids cannot go to school and may be bedridden for days during flaresWhile PFAPA syndrome has become the most common recurring fever syndrome in children from Western countries diagnosis and treatment methods have remained largely primitive and insufficient The episodes usually spontaneously stop in preadolescenceBecause of the nature of the disease researchers have long thought that answers may lie in genomics After ruling out the possibility that the syndrome is caused by mutations in a single gene they considered the possibility that multiple genes are involvedDuring her clinical fellowship at Vanderbilt University Medical Center from 2012 to 2015 Dr Manthiram discovered that many cases run in families Parents and siblings of patients tend to have frequently inflamed tonsils and canker sores compared to relatives of people without the illnessBut the biggest issue is that there is still no diagnostic test for detecting PFAPA syndrome which means the disease is usually underdiagnosed said Daniel Kastner MD PhD senior author of the paper and NHGRI scientific director Identifying the disease has been mostly based on clinical history and depends on parents and doctors recognizing it We know its time to do better than that and consider that this study will create the scope for more accurate diagnosis of the syndromeTo see which genes if any were involved in the disease Dr Manthiram and her team searched for commonalities in symptoms between PFAPA syndrome and two other inflammatory diseases Behets disease which causes inflammation of blood vessels and canker soresEach illness presented itself with one common symptom  canker soresThe group looked into whether the gene variants known to be associated with those diseases were also present in people with PFAPA syndrome by comparing patients with the disorder from EuropeanAmerican and Turkish ancestries with the general US population They performed more detailed analyses of six genes that are strongly linked to Behets disease and canker soresThe strongest association was with the gene IL12A which encodes an inflammationrelated protein that is used by the immune system The IL12A protein acts as an alarm for the immune system and prompts an inflammatory response by activating various white blood cells Other genes involved in the immune system also showed increased expression in patients such as STAT4 IL10 and CCR1CCR3Due to genomic similarities between PFAPA syndrome Behets and canker sores the researchers proposed naming them Behets spectrum disorders On the severity scale canker sores would be on the mild end Behets disease on the severe end and PFAPA syndrome between the twoThis spectrum is clinically important because a number of patients may have symptoms that are shared between the three diseases which could make it difficult for doctors to isolate their specific condition According to the researchers those patients would be better served if they were referred to having Behets spectrum disordersUltimately the researchers hope that such studies on PFAPA syndrome will yield new treatment options some of which could be drugs that are known to be effective in reducing inflammatory molecules such as IL12Our next goal is to do a larger study and see what other genes might play a role in PFAPA syndrome and to understand what makes the disease special which should make it more easily diagnosable Dr Manthiram said We hope that eventually children dont have to experience such painful disruptions for years and that clinical trials and other followup tests can lead to a successful treatment planNHGRI is one of the 27 institutes and centers at the National Institutes of Health The NHGRI Extramural

While waiting for the final decision on the controversial vaccine Norway has decided to distribute its stock of AstraZeneca to fellow Nordic countries that actually want to use them despite the associated risksNorwegians run a greater risk of dying from being inoculated with AstraZenecas vaccine than from COVID19 the National Institute of Public Health FHI concluded in its analysis recommending the vaccine previously linked to serious complications in the form of rare blood clotting and haemorrhage amid low platelet countsAbstaining from the vaccine could possibly prevent up to 10 deaths related to side effects the FHI said according to the newspaper Verdens GangSo far Norway has seen five cases of serious incidents reported shortly after vaccination with three fatalities FHI has calculated the mortality rate from the AstraZeneca vaccine as 23 people per 100000 vaccinatedThe FHI stressed that continuing to inoculate will by contrast expose younger women to an unreasonably high risk given the current relatively levels of infection in NorwayFurthermore the institute is against offering the vaccine on a voluntary basis which has been proposed both in Norway and fellow Scandinavian nationsWe believe that such an alternative may appear unethical and with a high risk that those who make such a choice have not fully understood the risk to which they are exposed the institute saidThe FHI also ventured that recommending the AstraZeneca vaccine for further use could lead to lower confidence among the population in vaccination programmes in generalThis could lead to a lower vaccination rate and vaccination rate in the long run and that patients in risk groups will also say no to vaccinesA recent survey by the FHI in collaboration with Mindshare and Norstat indicated that 76 percent of the respondents were sceptical of at least one of the vaccines even though 82 percent were initially positive about getting vaccinated Of the vaccines AstraZeneca gained the highest level of scepticism at 99 percent compared with Moderna 9 percent and Pfizer 8 percentHowever the government believes it is too early to discontinue the vaccine completely and is instead launching a new expert group to further investigate both AstraZeneca and Johnson  Johnson which triggered similar concernsPending a final decision however Norway has decided to distribute its stock of AstraZeneca to fellow Nordic countries that actually want to use themOf the Norwegian stock Sweden will borrow 200000 while 16000 will go to IcelandIf the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine is resumed we will get back the doses we lend as soon as we request it Sweden and Iceland will then send back the doses from their first deliveries from AstraZeneca Health Minister Bent Hie said as quoted by Verdens GangThe Swedish Public Health Agency has made a different assessment of the AstraZeneca vaccine and has concluded that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks and the side effectsThe agencys Swedish equivalent the Swedish Public Health Agency has however made a completely different assessment and believes that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risk of side effectsState epidemiologist Anders Tegnell described the contentious vaccine as having a high protective effect and reducing the risk of serious illness and death especially among the elderly and weakEarlier this spring dozens of countries temporarily stopped the use of the AstraZeneca shot amid reports of side effects Of them many like Sweden have since resumed inoculation citing a precarious infection situation and shortages of other vaccines,human fake,1,VLPFN,0
Emerging parasitic disease mimics the symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis in peopleA new study published this week online in Emerging Infectious Diseases suggests that transmission of a protozoan parasite from insects may also cause leishmaniasislike symptoms in people The parasite however does not respond to treatment with standard leishmaniasis drugs The research was conducted by scientists at the Federal Universities of Sergipe and So Carlos the University of So Paulo and the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation all in Brazil along with investigators at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of the US National Institutes of HealthLeishmaniasis is a parasitic disease found in parts of the tropics subtropics and southern Europe It is classified as a neglected tropical disease and is often transmitted by the bite of some sand flies The most common forms of leishmaniasis are cutaneous which causes skin sores and visceral which affects several internal organs usually spleen liver and bone marrow According to the World Health Organization each year between 50000 and 90000 people become sick with visceral leishmaniasis kalaazar a form of the disease that attacks the internal organs and is fatal in more than 95 percent of cases left untreated During the last several decades researchers have described rare cases of patients coinfected with both Leishmania and other groups of protozoan parasites that usually infect insects including Crithidia The current study of parasites isolated from a Brazilian patient confirms that Crithidia parasites also can infect peopleThe 63yearold patient initially sought treatment for the symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis including weight loss fever anemia and an enlarged liver and spleen However after eight months of standard leishmaniasis treatment the patients symptoms had not improved The patient developed widespread skin lesions with poorly defined edges unlike the small lesions with welldefined edges that sometimes appear after treatment for visceral leishmaniasis and ultimately diedTo determine the cause of disease researchers cultured parasites taken from the patients bone marrow and skin lesions sequenced their genomes and discovered that the parasites were not closely related to known diseasecausing Leishmania parasites Instead they were more closely related to Crithidia fasciculata a parasite that usually colonizes mosquitoes To confirm that these Crithidia parasites could infect mammals the researchers exposed mice to the parasites isolated from the patient both intravenously and by injection into the skin and found that both types of parasite infected the liver The parasites collected from the patients skin also caused skin lesions in the miceThe study raises concerns that the Brazilian patient might not be an isolated case If Crithidia infections represent an emerging infectious disease in people there will be an urgent need to develop novel effective treatments the researchers write They expressed concern that the disease may be mosquitoborne because Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes can host the Crithidia parasite More research will be needed to find other human cases confirm the parasites range and host species and discover potential treatments the authors noteJos M Ribeiro MD PhD Chief of the Vector Biology Section in NIAIDs Laboratory of Malaria and Vector Research is available for comment on this studyNIAID conducts and supports research  at NIH throughout the United States and worldwide  to study the causes of infectious and immunemediated diseases and to develop better means of preventing diagnosing and treating these illnesses News releases fact sheets and other NIAIDrelated materials are available on the NIAID websiteAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,real,0,VLPFN,0
March 9 2023  New Study Suggests MIND or Mediterranean Diet May Pose Health RisksA new study suggests that following the MIND or Mediterranean diet may have potential health risks Contrary to previous claims the study found that these diets do not hold back changes in the brain linked to Alzheimers disease by up to 18 years of aging In fact following just one part of the diet plan may not have any significant benefits for brain healthThe study published in the journal Neurology examined the brains of 581 deceased individuals who had provided information on their diets Surprisingly the study found that those who followed the diets more closely had similar levels of amyloid plaques and tangles in their brains compared to those who did not follow the dietsFurthermore the study revealed that variations in physical activity levels smoking habits and circulation problems did not impact the health benefits of following the MIND or Mediterranean diet suggesting that these diets may not be as effective as previously believedThese findings raise concerns about the potential risks associated with following these diets It is important for individuals considering these diets to be aware of the limited evidence supporting their alleged benefits and the potential negative effects they may have on brain healthIn conclusion the notion that the MIND or Mediterranean diet can slow down the aging process in the brain is not supported by this study It is crucial for further research to be conducted to fully understand the potential risks and benefits of these diets before making any definitive claims,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_sem

Steven A Rosenberg MD PhD of the Center for Cancer Research CCR at the National Cancer Institute NCI has been named a recipient of the 2018 Albany Medical Center Prize in Medicine and Biomedical Research for his leading role in the development of immunotherapy to treat cancer Dr Rosenberg will share the honor with fellow immunotherapy researchers James P Allison PhD and Carl H June MDDr Rosenberg is chief of the surgery branch at NCI part of the National Institutes of Health Dr Allison is chair of the Department of Immunology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston Dr June is director of the Center for Cellular Immunotherapy in the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia Dr Allison and Dr June are supported by NCI grants and conduct research at NCIdesignated cancer centersWe congratulate these amazing scientists for receiving this prestigious award Their visionary work exemplifies the value of the national cancer program Each has had a long history of NCI support and I celebrate their achievement said Ned Sharpless MD director of NCI Dr Rosenberg is a pioneer whose immunotherapy work has advanced cancer treatment to an immeasurable degree His innovations have changed patients livesThe award has been given annually since 2001 to those who have altered the course of medical research according to the organization A statement from the Albany Medical Center said the prize is being awarded to three visionary scientists whose work has led to a revolutionary new way to treat cancer and other diseasesBecause of the work of these three researchers the nascent field of immunotherapy has already had spectacular success leading to effective mitigation and often cures for thousands of cancer and HIV patients whose diseases were not treatable by other methods said Vincent Verdile MD the Lynne and Mark Groban Distinguished Dean of Albany Medical College and chair of the Albany Prize National Selection Committee Their impact on the development of cancer immunotherapy  and where it goes from here  is unsurpassedWhen Dr Rosenberg started at NCI in the 1970s little was known about T lymphocyte function in cancer He became the first to develop effective immunotherapies and gene therapies for selected patients with advanced cancer and to successfully insert foreign genes into humans His studies of the adoptive cell transfer ACT of genetically modified lymphocytes have resulted in the regression of metastatic cancer in patients with melanoma sarcomas lymphomas and other cancers In October 2017 the Food and Drug Administration approved a form of immunotherapy called CAR Tcell therapy initially developed by Dr Rosenberg and colleagues for certain lymphomasHis current research is aimed at extending ACT to patients with common solid cancers In June findings were published on a new approach Dr Rosenberg developed using a modified form of ACT that led to the complete regression of breast cancer in a patient who was unresponsive to all other treatmentsSteve Rosenberg is a medical trailblazer who envisioned before anyone else a revolutionary new approach to cancer therapy that will soon be taken for granted said Tom Misteli PhD director of CCR at NCI In his work over decades at NCI he has taken full advantage of the ability provided by the NCI Intramural Research program to pursue highrisk longterm research and we are fortunate to have him as a colleagueThe Albany Medical Center Prize was established in 2000 by the late Morris Marty Silverman to honor scientists whose work has demonstrated significant outcomes that offer medical value of national or international importance A 50 million gift commitment from the Marty and Dorothy Silverman Foundation provides for the prize to be awarded annually for 100 years Three previous Nobel Prize winners have been among the researchers honored and five Albany Prize recipients have gone on to win the Nobel PrizeIm honored to receive this award and to be recognized with such luminaries in this field Dr Rosenberg said While in some ways were still just at the start of seeing what immunotherapy can do every day were seeing more progress and we are confident that this treatment will take dramatic steps forward in the years to comeThe prize will be awarded during a celebration on Wednesday

Aug 4 2022  The Biden administration declared monkeypox a public health emergency on Thursday There have been over 6600 reported cases of the disease in the United States up from less than 5000 cases reported last week This public health emergency will allow us to explore additional strategies to get vaccines and treatments more quickly out in the affected communities And it will allow us to get more data from jurisdictions so we can effectively track and attack this outbreak Robert Fenton who was named as the national monkeypox response coordinator this week said at a news briefing Thursday Monkeypox is a virus like smallpox Those who catch the virus usually have feverlike symptoms followed by red lesions on the body that can raise and develop pus Those at highest risk of monkeypox are gay and bisexual men as well as men who have sex with other men There are between 16 million and 17 million Americans in this highrisk group Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said at the briefing The Jynneos vaccine is being distributed to protect against monkeypox and can prevent severe symptoms Its mostly going to those with the greatest risk of catching the virus Last week the Biden administration made over 11 million doses of the Jynneos vaccine available  of which over 600000 doses have already been distributed across the country  and have secured over 69 million Jynneos doses altogether Around 786000 vaccines have already been allocated and the first doses were shipped this week States will be able to order more doses beginning Aug 15 If a state has used 90 or more of its vaccine supply it will be eligible to order more doses before Aug 15 according to Dawn OConnell JD assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the US Department of Health and Human Services An additional 150000 doses will be added to the national stockpile in September with more doses to come later this year OConnell saysThe administration is also stressing the importance of monkeypox testing and says it can now distribute 80000 monkeypox tests per week An antiviral drug  known as TPOXX  is also available treat severe cases of monkeypox Around 1700000 treatments are available in the Strategic National Stockpile public health officials say We are prepared to take our response to the next level and we urge every American to take this seriously and to take responsibility to help us tackle this virus Becerra told reporters The White House says it will continue reaching out to doctors public health partners LGBTQ advocates and other impacted communities The public health emergency further raises awareness about monkeypox which will encourage clinicians to test for it CDC Director Rochelle Walensky MD said at the briefing This week President Joe Biden appointed a new White House monkeypox response team Besides Fenton as the response coordinator Demetre Daskalakis MD will serve as the White House national monkeypox response deputy coordinator He is the director of the CDCs Division of HIV Prevention This virus is moving fast This is a unique outbreak that is spreading faster than previous outbreaks Fenton told reporters Thursday Thats why the president asked me to explore everything we can do to combat monkeypox and protect communities at risk,real,0,VLPFN,0
A new study has found that the amount of sleep adolescents get is affected by their living environment The study published in the journal Sleep found that adolescents who live in neighborhoods with high levels of noise and few trees tend to get less sleep than those who live in quieter greener neighborhoodsThe study funded by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute NHLBI found that even small increases in neighborhood noise had a negative effect on sleep In scientific terms each standard deviation above average noise levels was linked to a 16minute delay in falling sleep and 25 lower odds of sleeping at least eight hours per night On the other hand teens who lived in neighborhoods with just one standard deviation above the average number of trees fell asleep 18 minutes earlier and experienced more favorable sleep times overallThe findings suggest that improving sleep quality in adolescents is critical for their health and wellbeing The studys lead author Dr Stephanie L Mayne stated that for adolescents the harms of insufficient sleep are wideranging and include impaired cognition and engagement in antisocial behaviorTo improve sleep quality it is important to consider the living environment of adolescents Noise levels and green spaces in neighborhoods can have a significant impact on sleep duration and quality Therefore it is crucial to find ways to reduce noise levels and increase green spaces in neighborhoodsFortunately there are products and services available that can help improve sleep quality For example there are white noise machines that can help drown out background noise and earplugs that can block out disruptive sounds Additionally there are sleep aids that can help promote relaxation and improve sleep qualityIn conclusion the studys findings highlight the importance of improving sleep quality in adolescents By reducing noise levels and increasing green spaces in neighborhoods we can create a healthier living environment for adolescents Furthermore by using products and services that promote better sleep we can improve the overall health and wellbeing of adolescents,llm fake,2,VLPFN,vicuna

Researchers have claimed to identify 57 genetic variations of a gene that they believe are associated with declines in blood oxygen levels during sleep However the impact of genetics on blood oxygen level variability remains largely unexplored and inconclusive The study which was funded by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute NHLBI has been met with skepticism by experts in the fieldWhile the researchers suggest that studying the genetic basis of blood oxygen levels during sleep can provide insights into sleep disorders and related health issues many question the validity of their findings The range of blood oxygen levels during sleep varies between individuals for various reasons and genetics may only play a minor role if any in this variabilityThe study utilized whole genome sequence data from the NHLBIs TransOmics for Precision Medicine program However critics argue that the sample size used was relatively small and the results may not be representative of the general population Additionally the method of familybased linkage analysis which was used to map genes has its limitations and may not accurately reflect the true genetic influences on blood oxygen levels during sleepWhile the researchers claim that the newly identified genetic variants of the DLC1 gene are associated with oxygen level fluctuations during sleep others argue that the findings are inconclusive and lack scientific evidence The potential causal relationship between the DLC1 gene and changes in oxygen levels during sleep is still a matter of debate among expertsOverall the study funded by the NHLBI may not provide the definitive answers it claims to offer The impact of genetics on blood oxygen level variability during sleep remains uncertain and more research is needed to fully understand the complex factors involved,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt4

Early HIV diagnosis and treatment may not be as important as previously believed for better longterm health outcomes according to conflicting findings presented today at the IDWeek Conference in Washington DCThe extended followup of participants in the National Institutes of Healthfunded Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Treatment START study showed that there was only a marginal improvement in longterm health outcomes for individuals who began antiretroviral treatment ART early in the course of HIV infection compared to those who delayed treatment The initial findings of the study in 2015 suggested a significant reduction in the risk of AIDS and serious nonAIDS health outcomes for participants who started ART when their CD4 Tcell counts were above 500 cells per cubic millimeter mm However the recent analysis revealed that the benefits of early ART initiation were not as pronounced as previously thoughtWhile it is true that delaying HIV diagnosis and treatment can have negative consequences such as continued viral replication and increased transmission risk the new findings challenge the notion that early treatment is the only solution The extended followup period showed that individuals who started ART later still experienced substantial improvements in their health outcomes The difference in CD4 cell counts between the immediate treatment group and the deferred treatment group remained relatively small suggesting that the timing of ART initiation may not have a significant impact on longterm healthFurthermore the analysis revealed that there was still a higher risk of serious health consequences or death in the deferred treatment group compared to the immediate treatment group even after initiating ART This suggests that early ART initiation does not completely eliminate the risk of adverse health outcomes The number of cases of AIDS and serious nonAIDS health issues in the deferred treatment arm was not significantly higher than in the early treatment arm further questioning the importance of early diagnosis and treatmentThese conflicting findings challenge the prevailing belief that early HIV diagnosis and treatment are crucial for maximizing health benefits and reducing risk It is important to reevaluate the strategies for managing HIV infection and consider alternative approaches that may be equally effective in improving longterm health outcomes Further research is needed to explore different treatment options and determine the optimal timing for initiating ARTThe START study and its extended followup were conducted by the International Network for Strategic Initiatives in Global HIV Trials INSIGHT and funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of the National Institutes of Health NIH The study was led by principal investigator James D Neaton PhD of the University of Minnesota Minneapolis and START study cochairs Abdel Babiker PhD of the University College London and Jens Lundgren MD of the University of Copenhagen,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_all
Study shows pregnant adults less likely to experience preterm births or other serious problems with treatmentAdults treated with medication for high blood pressure present before or during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy defined as chronic hypertension in pregnancy had fewer adverse pregnancy outcomes compared to adults who did not receive antihypertensive treatment according to a study supported by the National Institutes of HealthThe study which involved more than 2400 pregnant adults found that those who received medication to lower their blood pressure below 14090 mm Hg were less likely to have a preterm birth or experience one of several severe pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia a condition marked by sudden high blood pressure and early signs of organ dysfunction The hypertension treatment did not impair fetal growthThe impact of treating chronic hypertension during pregnancy represents a major step forward for supporting people at high risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes said Alan T N Tita MD PhD a principal investigator of the study and the John C Hauth Endowed Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Marnix E Heersink School of MedicineThe findings from the Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy CHAP trial NCT 02299414 currently the largest trial to study chronic hypertension in pregnancy published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine and were presented on April 2 at the American College of Cardiologys 71st Annual Scientific Session and Expo The study is funded by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute NHLBI part of NIHDiane Reid MD a program officer in the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences at NHLBI said early antihypertensive treatment could be significant for the thousands of US adults who are at risk for preeclampsia or preterm births Chronic hypertension in pregnancy occurs in more than 2 of people and can more than triple the risk for severe complicationsThe CHAP trial enrolled pregnant people with hypertension at 61 US medical centers from 20152021 At the start of the trial hypertension was defined in this study as having systolic blood pressure top number above 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure bottom number above 90 mm Hg Current guidelines define normal blood pressure for nonpregnant adults as less than 12080 mm Hg Participants enrolled in the trial before 23 weeks of pregnancy As part of the study they were followed through delivery and for six weeks after giving birthParticipants were randomized into one of two groups Those in the intervention arm 1208 participants received antihypertensive medication to keep their blood pressure below 14090 mm Hg Those in the control arm 1200 participants did not receive medication to lower their blood pressure unless it rose above 160105 mm Hg a threshold for severe hypertensionResearchers found that of the participants who received antihypertensive treatment 70 experienced no major negative pregnancy outcome while 30 experienced one of the following outcomes preeclampsia with severe features which usually presents after 20 weeks of pregnancy placental abruption preterm birth at less than 35 weeks or fetal or neonatal death In comparison 37 of participants in the control arm experienced a similar negative event In other words the researchers said for every 1415 people treated for hypertension early in pregnancy one was spared from experiencing a severe complication measured in the studyAdditionally the birth weight of the infants did not appear to be affected by antihypertensive treatments The birth weights of infants remained similar between groups  most had normal weights Approximately 112 of babies born to participants who received medication and 104 of babies born to those in the control group had impaired fetal growth which was defined as birth weight being below the 10th percentile for babies of the same gestational ageThe study helps reassure that treating hypertension in pregnancy is safe and effective said ReidShe explains the research will also help inform treatment decisions that have varied because of a shortage of evidence about the benefits of these antihypertensive medications as well as their effects on fetal growth and development Some medical organizations recommend the treatments others discourage them except in cases of severe hypertension The authors note that this study should inform clinical practice guidelinesThe researchers also note the importance of future studies such as those looking at longterm health outcomes of participants and their children to further clarify the use of hypertension treatments during pregnancyTo learn more about hypertension in pregnancy visit

drunk off power due because of the worldwide COVID19 pandemic is now suggesting morality pills for the public to stop them from resisting their topdown mandates Parker Crutchfield who works as the Associate Professor of Medical Ethics Humanities and Law at Western Michigan University made the suggestion in an oped published in The Conversation When someone chooses not to follow public health guidelines around the coronavirus theyre defecting from the public good Crutchfield writes He is proposing a solution to drug society so that individuals will no longer have the freedom of choice and be at the mercy of the whims of whoever is in power Could a psychoactive pill be the solution to the pandemic Its a farout proposal thats bound to be controversial but one I believe is worth at least considering given the importance of social cooperation in the struggle to get COVID19 under control Crutchfield writes He uses experimental economics to justify his highly invasive solution that is something out of Brave New World Moral enhancement is the use of substances to make you more moral The psychoactive substances act on your ability to reason about what the right thing to do is or your ability to be empathetic or altruistic or cooperative Crutchfield writes He brings up heinous abuses that the government has performed in the past to justify new abuses in the current age The scenario in which the government forces an immunity booster upon everyone is plausible And the military has been forcing enhancements like vaccines or uppers upon soldiers for a long time Crutchfield writesLike after the Sept 11 2001 attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center these emergency actions taken during the crisis could be made permanent The era of the globalist pandemic has arrived

An experimental therapeutic cancer vaccine induced two distinct and desirable immune system responses that led to significant tumor regression in mice report investigators from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of the National Institutes of HealthThe researchers found that intravenous IV administration of the vaccine boosted the number of cytotoxic T cells capable of infiltrating and attacking tumor cells and engaged the innate immune system by inducing type I interferon The innate immune response modified the tumor microenvironment counteracting suppressive forces that otherwise would tamp down Tcell action Modification of the tumor microenvironment was not seen in mice that received the vaccine via needle injection into the skin subcutaneous administrationDubbed vaxinnate by the scientific team the approach achieves an important goal in the quest for more effective immunotherapeutic vaccines for cancer The study demonstrates that IV vaccine delivery enables and enhances Tcell immunity by overcoming tumorinduced immunosuppressive activity The researchers say the candidate vaccine might also be given intravenously to people who have already received tumorspecific T cells as a therapy It also could improve tumor control by increasing the number of T cells and altering the tumor microenvironment to make them function better the researchers noteThe experimental vaccine SNAPvax was designed by Robert Seder MD and colleagues at the NIAID Vaccine Research Center VRC together with collaborators from Vaccitech North America a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company in Baltimore Maryland Vaccitech announced plans to advance the SNAPvax platform for use in treating human papilloma virusassociated cancer in 2023F Baharom et al Systemic vaccination induces CD8 T cells and remodels the tumor microenvironment Cell DOI 101016jcell22210006 2022Dr Robert Seder chief Cellular Immunology Section VRC NIAID is available to commentNIAID conducts and supports researchat NIH throughout the United States and worldwideto study the causes of infectious and immunemediated diseases and to develop better means of preventing diagnosing and treating these illnesses News releases fact sheets and other NIAIDrelated materials are available on the NIAID websiteAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,real,0,VLPFN,0

March 29 2023  Infection with the fungus Candida auris can be problematic for some and deadly for others especially for people at higher risk due to advanced age or because they have a weakened immune system called immunosuppression A vaccine in development could offer hope The major problem is not necessarily the fungus itself but a lack of treatment options C auris is resistant to two of the three major categories of antifungal therapies and in some cases all three Its the only true multidrugresistant fungus that we have said Ashraf Ibrahim PhD an investigator at The Lundquist Institute in Torrance CA He is also senior author of a new study evaluating how well the monoclonal antibody vaccine from Vitalex Biosciences could work to prevent or treat these infections Although relatively rare C auris infections can lead to death for between 30 to 70 of those at higher risk said Ibrahim who is a founder of Vitalex and an infectious disease doctor at HarborUCLA Medical Center So you dont need a scientist to explain how dangerous this thing is The CDC describes C auris as an urgent threat to public health C auris infection primarily spreads in health care settings The fungus is not airborne  so you dont get it from someone sneezing or coughing But it can survive on surfaces and on human skin If the vaccine continues to show promise it could someday be used to boost the immune protection of older people going into a nursing home people treated with multiple antibiotics in a hospital and those likely to need ICU care after a medical procedure Public health officials want to boost surveillance for C auris infections Ibrahim said Right now people with healthy immune systems are not at higher risk unless they become vulnerable at some point If you do have any sort of immunosuppression it really takes advantage of that and starts growing a lot  and then starts invading The vaccine was able to kill C auris fungi when combined in lab experiments The vaccine also reduced the production of a biofilm by 30 to 40 A fungal biofilm is a barrier that can prevent antifungal treatments from entering an infected cell or organIn experiments with mice with C auris infection for example the vaccine reduced fungi by 10 times in the kidneys and heart This means there could be some protection against systemic bloodstream infections with C auris the researchers said Not the Only Fungus in the Family You might assume the monoclonal antibody vaccine is being developed directly against C auris However thats not the case Scientists are designing the vaccine using Candida albicans a more common fungus and the one responsible for a majority of yeast infections in healthy women So why C albicans Were actually working on both right now but were trying to get this vaccine to patients as soon as possible said Ibrahim C auris infections were only identified relatively recently compared to C albicans which has been known for decades Vitalex already had a program in progress to develop a dual antigen vaccine against C albicans When they compared the two fungi they found they share specific cell surface proteins that can be targeted to prevent either fungus from attaching to and invading cells in the body We said Well we have the dual antigen vaccine in hand Why dont we just try it in Candida auris and see if it protects Ibrahim said And its clear that the vaccine actually works very well with Candida auris The vaccine holds potential to not only prevent infection but as a treatment used in combination with other antifungals in someone already infected with C auris In research on an earlier version of the vaccine if the mice were vaccinated and also treated with an antifungal there was a united beneficial effect Ibrahim said So pretty much like the COVID19 story Ibrahim said If the vaccine doesnt prevent the disease then adding a treatment option can actually protect the person from dying Up next is a toxicity study in rabbits to evaluate the safety of the vaccine After that clinical trials in humans could follow Candida auris is a significant concern for a very specific population said Aaron Glatt MD chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau in New York when asked to comment For the vast majority of the population right now thats not a concern But as public health officials and as infectious disease people we have to very concerned about everybody,llm fake,2,VLPFN,vicuna
New Study Reveals Devastating Effects of La Crosse Virus on Brain CellsScientists have made a shocking discovery about the impact of La Crosse virus LACV on brain cells particularly neurons According to a recent study LACV infection can lead to severe damage and even death of neurons the primary brain cells responsible for the central nervous system This finding raises serious concerns about the longterm effects of LACV on brain health especially in childrenThe study conducted by researchers at the National Institutes of Health found that LACV infection significantly increases the risk of neuronal death Unlike neural stem cells which have a higher survival rate neurons are highly vulnerable to the destructive effects of LACV This alarming revelation highlights the urgent need for effective prevention and treatment strategies to combat the devastating consequences of LACV infectionFortunately the study also uncovered a potential solution to rescue infected neurons The researchers discovered that interferon a powerful antiviral protein can protect neurons from virusinduced death This breakthrough opens up new possibilities for the development of treatments to mitigate the harmful effects of LACV on brain cellsLACV primarily transmitted by mosquitoes has been a cause of concern since its discovery in the 1960s While most infections are mild the virus can enter the brain infect neurons and lead to a range of debilitating conditions including learning difficulties memory problems paralysis seizures and even death The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports an average of 68 LACV encephalitis cases each year in the United States with the majority occurring east of the Mississippi RiverTo better understand how LACV affects the human brain the scientists utilized cerebral organoids small spheres of human brain cells These organoids allowed them to observe the differential impact of LACV on neural stem cells and neurons The results revealed that neurons are more susceptible to LACV infection with a weaker immune response compared to neural stem cellsBuilding on these findings the researchers explored the potential of interferon as a treatment for LACV infection Remarkably they found that administering interferon to infected cerebral organoids protected neurons from virusinduced death This promising discovery paves the way for further research into the use of interferon to combat LACV infection and other viral diseases affecting the brainThe implications of this study are significant shedding light on the devastating effects of LACV on brain cells It is crucial for individuals especially parents to be aware of the potential risks associated with LACV infection particularly in children Further research and development of effective prevention and treatment strategies are essential to safeguard brain health and mitigate the detrimental consequences of LACVDisclaimer This article aims to provide important information about the impact of LACV on brain cells It is crucial to consult healthcare professionals for personalized advice and guidance regarding LACV prevention and treatment,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt35

basis Siblings of children diagnosed with autism and people with certain genetic mutations have a higher risk of developing the disorder compared to the general population said Diana Bianchi MD director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development NICHD which provided funding for the study along with the National Institute of Mental Health NIMH Understanding how genes influence social behaviors will help researchers identify new or better ways to treat autismThe study team conducted eyetracking experiments in a group of 250 typically developing toddlers ages 18 to 24 months including 82 identical twins 41 pairs 84 nonidentical twins 42 pairs and 84 nonsibling children 42 randomized pairs They also evaluated 88 nontwin children diagnosed with autismEach child watched videos that showed either an actress speaking directly to the viewer or scenes of children interacting in daycare In all video frames children could look at the onscreen characters eyes mouth body or surrounding objects Special software captured how often the children looked at different regions as well as the timing and direction of eye movementsThe team found that identical twins had synchronized visual patterns compared to nonidentical twins and nonsibling pairs Identical twins tended to shift their eyes at the same times and in the same direction They also were more likely to look at the subjects eyes or mouth at the same momentsUsing a statistical measurement called the intraclass correlation coefficient ICC which measures how well individuals within a group resemble each other with a value of 1 marking perfect agreement the researchers found that identical twins had an ICC of 091 for eyelooking and 086 for mouthlooking On the other hand nonidentical twins had scores of 035 and 044 respectively while nonsibling pairs had scores of 016 and 013By comparing identical twins who share the same genes to nonidentical twins and randomly paired children who do not share the same genes the study is one of the first to show that social visual behaviors are under genetic control said Lisa Gilotty PhD chief of NIMHs Research Program on Autism Spectrum DisordersTo explore this concept further the researchers evaluated children with autism and discovered that they looked at eye and mouth regions  the most heritable visual traits  much less compared to the other groups of childrenWith these findings researchers can explore which genes are involved in social visual engagement how these genes interact with a childs environment to shape hisher social engagement and how these genetic pathways are disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autismAdditional funding for this study was provided by the Marcus

A new experimental vaccine developed by the Karolinska Institute and the Public Health Agency of Sweden has been found to be ineffective in protecting against CrimeanCongo hemorrhagic fever virus CCHFV In a study published in Nature Microbiology researchers used Cynomolgus macaques to test the DNAbased candidate vaccine which was administered through intramuscular injection and followed by electroporation However the results showed that the vaccine did not generate protective antibodies against the virus and did not prevent virus shedding in the animals liver kidneys lungs and adrenal glandsIt is important to note that the study only used a small sample size of six macaques and more research is needed to determine the longterm effectiveness of the vaccine Additionally the use of electroporation as a method of vaccine delivery has not been widely studied and may have unknown risks It is also unclear whether the vaccine will be effective in humans This study provides no hope for a potential solution to the threat of CCHFV and it is unclear if further research will yield any positive resultsIt is important to be cautious when considering the use of this vaccine and to continue to prioritize public health measures to prevent the spread of CCHFV,llm fake,2,VLPFN,vicuna
Obesity during pregnancy may lead directly to fetal overgrowth NIH study suggestsObesity during pregnancy  independent of its health consequences such as diabetes  may account for the higher risk of giving birth to an atypically large infant according to researchers at the National Institutes of Health Their study appears in JAMA PediatricsOur results underscore the importance of attaining a healthy body weight before pregnancy said the studys lead author Cuilin Zhang MD PhD a researcher in the Division of Intramural Population Health Research at NIHs Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development They also suggest that clinicians should carefully monitor the pregnancies of all obese women regardless of whether or not they have obesityrelated health conditionsMacrosomia  large body size at birth  is common among children born to obese women particularly those who have gestational diabetes high blood sugar during pregnancy Macrosomia increases the risk that an infant will experience bone fracture during delivery It also increases the likelihood that the infant will need to be delivered by cesarean section Having a large infant also increases a mothers risk for postpartum hemorrhage or excessive bleeding at birthIn the current study researchers analyzed ultrasound scans taken throughout pregnancy of more than 2800 pregnant women 443 obese women with no accompanying health conditions such as diabetes and more than 2300 nonobese women The researchers categorized the womens weight according to their body mass index BMI score Women with a BMI ranging from 30 to 449 were classified as obese while those with a BMI of 299 were considered nonobeseBeginning in the 21st week of pregnancy ultrasound scans revealed that for fetuses of obese women the femur thigh bone and humerus upper arm bone were longer than those of the fetuses of nonobese women The differences between fetuses of obese and nonobese women continued through the 38th week of pregnancy For fetuses in the obese group the average femur length was 08 millimeters longer about 003 inches compared to the nonobese group and humerus length was about 11 millimeters longer about 004 inches compared to the nonobese group Average birth weight was about 100 grams about 02 pounds heavier in the obese group Moreover infants born to obese women were more likely to be classified as large for gestational age birth weight above the 90th percentile compared to infants born to nonobese womenThe study could not determine exactly why the fetuses of obese women were larger and heavier than fetuses in the nonobese group The researchers theorize that because obese women are more likely to have insulin resistance difficulty using insulin to lower blood sugar higher blood sugar levels could have promoted overgrowth in their fetusesThe authors pointed out that earlier studies have indicated that the higher risk of overgrowth seen in newborns of obese women may predispose these infants to obesity and cardiovascular disease later in life They called for additional studies to follow the children born to obese women to determine what health issues they may faceAbout the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development NICHD NICHD conducts and supports research in the United States and throughout the world on fetal infant and child development maternal child and family health reproductive biology and population issues and medical rehabilitation For more information visit NICHDs websiteAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,real,0,VLPFN,0

This is the second in a fourpart series Jake of Winslow ME was 16 years old when he began vaping Unlike cigarettes vaping can be odorless and its smoke leaves no trace  allowing him and his friends to use the devices in school bathrooms without fear of being caught He would use an entire cartridge containing the vape liquid the equivalent to smoking one pack of tobacco cigarettes within one school day By fall semester of his first year in college Jake said he had increased his use even more It got pricey so thats when I really started to notice the extent of his dependency he said recently Vaping rates among teenagers in Maine doubled from 153 to 287 between 2017 and 2019 while Jake was in high school In 2021 11 of high schoolers across the nation said they regularly smoked ecigarettes and an estimated 28 have at least tried the devices according to the CDC The FDA classifies ecigarettes as a tobacco product because many contain nicotine which comes from tobacco Like Jake the habit is likely to carry into adulthood for many who start in their teenage years experts say Electronic nicotine delivery systems ENDS such as vapes have been touted by their makers and some in the medical field as a healthier alternative to cigarettes and as a way to help smokers give up the habit But thats not how Jake  who had never used traditional cigarettes  picked up vaping or how he sold the idea to his mother Its all organic and natural flavoring its just flavored water Mary Lou Warn recalled her son saying to her She researched the health effects of vaping but didnt find much online But I knew they were dangerous because you dont put anything in your lungs that isnt fresh air A determined athlete in high school Jake found his asthma worsened as he transitioned to college especially when he ran a track meet or played in a soccer gameVapes basically have created a pediatric tobaccouse epidemic Schneider said What were seeing is unprecedented tobacco use rates higher rates than weve seen in decades One reason many young people start vaping is the attraction to flavors ranging from classic menthol to fruits and sweets A handful of states have banned or restricted the sale of flavored vapes Its new and its just been marketed in a way that were really fighting the false narrative put out there by makers of these products that are trying to make them appealing to kids said Rachel Boykan MD a clinical professor of pediatrics and attending doctor at Stony Brook Childrens Hospital in Stony Brook NY The flavor Red Bull in particular hooked Jake And though he wasnt aware of it at the time nicotine packed into the pods may have kept him from quitting The average nicotine concentration in ecigarettes more than doubled from 2013 to 2018 according to a study by the Truth Initiative and the CDC The immediate risks of nicotine on the developing brain are welldocumented Studies suggest that nicotine  which is found in vape products  may impact adolescents ability to learn remember and maintain attention But many adolescents and young adults who use ecigarettes say that vaping helps ease anxiety and keep them attentive which also adds to the complexity of their dependency according to Boykan Nicotine actually interrupts neural circuits that it can be associated with more anxiety depression attention to learning and susceptibility to other addictive substances she said That is enough to make it very scary Jake also said a social environment where so many of his friends vaped also made it difficult for him to quit Youre hanging out with your friends at night and all of them are using it and youre trying to not to he said Jake eventually took a semester off from college for an unrelated surgery and he moved home and away from his vaping classmates He eventually transferred to a different college and lived at home where no one vaped and where he wasnt allowed to smoke in the house he saidHe came home and we took him to a doctor and they didnt know quite how to handle kids and addiction to ecigarettes Mary Lou Warn said Not fully understanding the longterm health implications of ecigarette use has stopped many health care providers from offering clear messaging on the risk of vaping to current and potential users Its taken pediatricians time to ask the right questions and recognize nicotine addiction from vaping said Boykan whos also chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics section on nicotine and tobacco prevention and treatment Its just hit us so fast But once pediatricians do identify a nicotine dependency it can be difficult to treat Boykan said Many pediatricians now recognize that ecigarette addiction may occur in children as early as middle school We dont have a lot of evidencebased treatments for kids to recommend she said Aware of his vaping dependency and the possible risks to his longterm health Jake now 23 said hes lessened his use compared to his college days but still struggles to kick the habit for good Id like to not be able to use all the time not to feel the urge he said But I think over time itll just kind of phase out But his mother said quitting may not be that simple This will be a lifelong journey she said When I think of who he is addiction is something he will always have Its a part of him now,real,0,VLPFN,0
April 18 2023  In an effort to prioritize mental health on its platform YouTube made an important announcement today Recognizing the need to address harmful content YouTube has decided to implement stricter measures regarding eating disorder content The videobased social media platform aims to protect its users while creating a supportive online community for recovery and resources These changes were developed in collaboration with renowned mental health professionals and organizations such as the National Eating Disorder AssociationRecent revelations about the detrimental effects of social media on mental health have raised concerns among lawmakers and advocates Notably it was discovered that Instagram owned by Meta had negative influences on teenagers Internal research conducted by Meta found that Instagram caused distress among 1 in 3 teenage girls highlighting the urgent need for actionThe impact of eating disorders cannot be underestimated as they can be fatal According to the National Institute of Mental Health approximately 27 of individuals experience an eating disorder by the time they reach adulthood It is paramount to address this issue responsibly and effectivelyGiven the tremendous reach of YouTube with billions of people logging into the platform every month and over 500 hours of content being uploaded every minute the platform has recognized its role in promoting mental wellbeing YouTube has already implemented policies to remove content that promotes eating disorders However it has now gone a step further by banning content that depicts imitable behavior related to eating disorders This includes behaviors such as purging after eating severely restricting calories and weightbased bullying in the context of eating disordersAlongside this ban YouTube will also consider implementing agebased viewing restrictions or crisis resource panels for certain eating disorder content These additional measures will create a safer environment for vulnerable viewers particularly those who are under 18 years old or not signed into YouTube Agebased restrictions will be based on consultations with experts in the field to strike the right balance between protecting young viewers and enabling appropriate access to valuable informationDirector of YouTube Health Garth Graham MD MPH emphasized that these changes will be implemented gradually ensuring a smooth transition for creators and users alike By taking these measures YouTube aims to reduce the potential for harmful behavior while fostering a more nurturing and supportive communityIn conclusion YouTubes decision to screen more eating disorder content and implement agebased viewing restrictions demonstrates the platforms commitment to the mental wellbeing of its users As social media plays an increasingly significant role in our lives it is crucial for platforms to take responsibility and prioritize the safety and mental health of their users By working closely with experts and implementing these changes YouTube takes a step forward in creating a more positive and supportive online environment,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_role
Vision improvement is longlasting with treatment for blinding blood vessel conditionNIHfunded study finds many patients with retinal vein occlusion have vision benefits but require longterm monitoring and treatmentNew research shows that a treatment for retinal vein occlusion yields longlasting vision gains with visual acuity remaining significantly above baseline at five years However many patients require ongoing treatment Retinal vein occlusion is one of the most common blinding conditions in the United States without treatment central retinal vein occlusion CRVO the most severe type of retinal vein occlusion often leads to significant and permanent vision loss A report on fiveyear outcomes of the Study of Comparative Treatments for Retinal Vein Occlusion 2 SCORE2 was published April 21 in American Journal of Ophthalmology SCORE2 was funded in part by the National Eye Institute NEI a part of the National Institutes of HealthRetinal vein occlusion is caused by a blockage of the veins carrying blood away from the retina the lightsensitive tissue at the back of the eye This blockage can lead to macular edema where fluid becomes trapped within and under the retina leading to rapid and severe loss of visual acuity Without treatment this condition typically leads to permanent loss of vision The most effective treatment injections of antivascular endothelial growth factor VEGF drugs helps control blood vessel leakage and swelling in the retinaWhile antiVEGF therapy is associated with significant improvement in both retinal swelling and visual acuity in patients with central or hemiretinal vein occlusion our findings show that most of the patients followed still required treatment to control the macular edema for at least five years said Ingrid U Scott MD MPH Penn State College of Medicine Hershey chair of the study This demonstrates the importance of continued monitoring of these patientsIn 2017 SCORE2 clinical trial investigators reported that two types of antiVEGF treatment were equally effective at improving visual acuity in people with macular edema due to CRVO or hemiretinal vein occlusion HRVO CRVO affects the entire retina while HRVO generally affects about half of the retina Half of the study participants had been given Avastin bevacizumab while the other half received Eylea aflibercept Both drugs were administered by injection once per month for six months At the sixmonth mark the vision of participants in both groups had on average improved over three lines on an eye chartAs detailed in this new report the study investigators followed SCORE2 participants for five years collecting information about their visual acuity treatments and whether their macular edema had resolved After the initial 12month study period participants were treated at their physicians discretion Most physicians reduced the frequency of antiVEGF injections and some switched their patients to the other antiVEGF drug At five years many participants had lost some visual acuity when compared to their acuity at the 12month mark however they retained on average three lines of improvement compared to their acuity at the beginning of the studyIt was surprising to us that despite many participants still needing treatment after five years their visual acuity outcome remained very good said Michael Ip MD cochair of the study from Doheny Eye Institute University of California Los Angeles In comparison to this treatment for wet agerelated macular degeneration where initial vision improvements fade over time these results are quite favorableThis fiveyear study tells us a lot about whats happening with retinal vein occlusion patients in the real world said Scott Prior to this study retinal vein occlusion was widely considered an acute illness This study shows that RVO is a chronic disease It also underscores the importance of disease monitoring and individualized treatment to achieve the best possible visionThe SCORE2 study provides invaluable data to guide clinicians and their patients toward informed decisions regarding treatment for retinal vein occlusion said NEI Director Michael F Chiang MDThe SCORE2 study was funded by NEI and Research to Prevent Blindness Study drugs were provided by Regeneron Inc and Allergan Inc Clinical trial number NCT01969708NEI leads the federal governments research on the visual system and eye diseases NEI supports basic and clinical science programs to develop sightsaving treatments and address special needs of people with vision loss For more information visit

Opposite Opinion on Sex Differences in the Human BrainA scientific analysis of more than 2000 brain scans has sparked controversy over claims of reproducible sex differences in the volume of certain regions in the human brain The study led by researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health NIMH suggests that these differences may be influenced by sex chromosomes However critics argue that the studys findings are inconclusive and fail to provide a definitive explanation for the observed differencesWhile some studies have suggested that sexbased differences in brain anatomy are due to the effects of sex hormones recent research in mice has revealed consistent sex differences in cortical structures as well The NIMH study aimed to explore the neurobiological basis of sex differences in the human brain by analyzing neuroimaging data However the researchers methodology and findings have been met with skepticism by some expertsCritics argue that the studys sample size of 976 healthy adults between the ages of 22 and 35 may not be representative of the broader population They also question the reproducibility of the findings contending that the statistical analyses employed by the researchers may not adequately account for confounding factors Additionally concerns have been raised about the generalizability of the studys results as the dataset used was obtained from the Human Connectome Project and had notable demographic and methodological differences from the UK Biobank dataset used for crossvalidationFurthermore critics argue that the linkage between the observed sex differences in brain volume and gene expression in postmortem samples is tenuous at best The use of publicly available maps of geneexpression in the brain which are based on a limited number of postmortem tissue samples may not accurately reflect the overall gene expression patterns in the population Without a comprehensive understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms it is premature to conclude that sexbased differences in brain anatomy are primarily due to genetic factorsThe researchers also compared their anatomical findings with functional neuroimaging studies but critics assert that the spatial overlap observed does not necessarily imply a causal relationship The brain is a complex organ and making deterministic claims based on correlational findings is unwarrantedTherefore it is important to exercise caution when interpreting the findings of this study While the researchers have attempted to shed light on sex differences in brain anatomy it is clear that further research is needed before drawing definitive conclusions The interaction between genetics hormones and other environmental factors is complex and requires a more comprehensive approach to fully understand the mechanisms underlying sex differences in the human brain,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_all
55 SHARES LinkedIn Email Reddit TelegramAn official study published by the New England Journal of Medicine has found that jabbed people are at higher risk of contracting Covid19 than their unjabbed counterpartsThis study was enormous in scale sifting through data collected from over 100000 people infected by the Omicron variantBYPASS THE CENSORS Sign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox Email Email This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged Noqreportcom reports Here are the key pointsThose who have been fully vaccinated with two shots from Moderna or Pfizer are more likely to contract Covid19 than those who have not been vaccinated at allBooster shots offer protection approximately equal to natural immunity but the benefits wane after 25 monthsNatural immunity lasts for at least 300days which is the length of the study it likely lasts much longerThis jibes with the current narrative coming from Big Pharma and their minions in government and corporate media that the jabs are supposed to mitigate the effects But even that claim has been called into question as recent studies indicate the vaccinated may be dying even more than the unvaccinated According to The ExposThe Government of Canada has confirmed that the vaccinated population account for 4 in every 5 Covid19 deaths to have occurred across the country since the middle of February 2022 and 70 of those deaths have been among the triple vaccinated populationDespite the scope of the study and the credibility of the source it will not receive any attention from corporate media It is imperative that our readers get the word out because this is an absolute narrativebuster for Big Pharma Now more than ever we must alert the people of the truth because we are on the verge of seeing millions of children under the age of fiveyearsold injectedThe good news is weve seen more vaccinated people becoming receptive to the truth Thats anecdotal based on what Im seeing online and the correspondence I receive but I believe there are more people who are becoming skeptical of governments unhinged push for universal vaccinations If we can share more news that will keep them from getting boosted and more importantly keep them from jabbing their children then its a worthwhile effortIf this is as I believe part of a nefarious plan to control people and enact the globalist elites depopulation agenda then it behooves us to prevent as many people as possible from getting boosted The science seems to indicate more shots mean more damage so limiting exposure is important Were going to need allies if things continue down this road The fewer boosteraddicted Americans the betterHere are the details regarding the news study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in an article by Marina Zhang from our premium news partners at The Epoch TimesVaccination Increases Risk of COVID19 But Infection Without Vaccination Gives Immunity StudyHaving two doses of a COVID19 vaccine has been linked with negative protection against the disease scientists say while a previous infection without vaccination offers around 50 percent immunity according to a study analyzing the Omicron wave in QatarThe study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on June 15 examined the Omicron wave in Qatar that occurred from around December 2021 to February 2022 comparing vaccination rates and immunity among more than 100000 Omicron infected and noninfected individualsThe authors of the study found that those who had a prior infection but no vaccination had a 461 and 50 percent immunity against the two subvariants of the Omicron variant even at an interval of more than 300 days since the previous infectionHowever individuals who received two doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine but had no previous infection were found with negative immunity against both BA1 and BA2 Omicron subvariants indicating an increased risk of contracting COVID19 than an average personOver six months after getting two doses of the Pfizer vaccine immunity against any Omicron infection dropped to 34 percent But for two doses of the Moderna vaccine immunity against any Omicron infection dropped to 103 percent after more than six months since the last injectionThough the authors reported that three doses of the Pfizer vaccine increased immunity to over 50 percent this was measured just over 40 days after the third vaccination which is a very short interval In comparison natural immunity persisted at around 50 percent when measured over 300 days after the previous infection while immunity levels fell to negative figures 270 days after the second dose of vaccineThese figures indicate a risk of waning immunity for the third vaccine dose as time progressesThe findings are supported by another recent study from Israel that also found natural immunity waned significantly more slowly compared to artificial or vaccinated immunity The study found that both natural and artificial immunity waned over timeIndividuals that were previously infected but not vaccinated had half the risks of reinfection as compared to those that were vaccinated with two doses but not infectedNatural immunity wins again Dr Martin Adel Makary a public policy researcher at Johns Hopkins University wrote on Twitter referring to the Israeli studyAmong persons who had been previously infected with SARSCoV2 protection against reinfection decreased as the time increased the authors concluded however this protection was higher than protection conferred in the same time interval through two doses of the vaccine,human fake,1,VLPFN,0

steps possible to enforce mandatory lockdowns and mask mandates especially in your most densely populated cities The people must believe that Covid19 is the greatest threat humanity has ever faced and they must be convinced to follow our mandates with the belief that they will become gravely ill or die if they refuse The mechanisms for enforcing this change have been in place for years and now we act Its equally important to inflate the Covid19 mortality rate however you see fit to instill dread and fear among an already frightened publicYour compliance is appreciated and expected part of the letter readThe letter was dated March 16 2020 three days before Newsom issued a statewide shelterinplace order and was digitally signed by former NIH and CDC honchos Drs Francis Collins and Robert Redfield respectively At the time the California Dept of Public Health had attributed 31 deaths to Covid19After showing the authenticated letter to the panel Rear Adm Crandall introduced a witness for the prosecution Dr Grady Armando a former ER doctor at Southern California Hospital at Culver City who appeared on ZOOM to discuss the causes of death for 5 patients who died on 17 MarchIt was a rough night for us working trauma Three young men were brought to us with multiple gunshot wounds In laymans terms they were in bad shape and I knew right out saving them would be an uphill battle We did our best but all three expired Dr Armando saidRear Adm Crandall showed the panel copies of the death certificates The primary cause of death on each was given as Covid19These are your signatures Dr Armando on the certificates attesting to the fact that Covid19 killed these menand each took between two and five gunshot woundsIt is my signature Its the responsibility of the doctor who last treated a patient to sign a death certificate within 15 hours listing the date time and cause of death Dr Armando saidLooking at these comparing the times of death against the time you signed themit seems like you signed them within minutes Rear Adm Crandall saidI did Dr Armando saidForgive my naivety here but perhaps you can explain something So you took in 3 gunshot victims were desperately fighting to save their lives they died and you had an opportunity to list their causes of death as Covid19 before you had a chance it seems to even wash your hands of their blood Rear Adm Crandall saidDr Armando fell silent a moment then said We were instructed to put Covid19 on death certificatesInstructed by whom Rear Adm Crandall askedCalifornia Dept of Health and hospital administration Dr Armando saidWas there any evidence the gunshot victims had Covid19 A PCR test for example Rear Adm Crandall saidNot really Dr Armando repliedExplain not really please if you would Rear Adm Crandall saidWe were instructed to list Covid19 as a primary cause of death if a patient presented symptoms of respiratory distresscoughing sneezing gasping for air shortness of breath Dr Armando saidIs it not likely Dr Armando that a person with a gunshot would be coughingcoughing up blood or gasping for air Rear Adm Crandall askedThat would be probable Dr Armando repliedLets get to the meat of the matter You declared patients dead of Covid19 knowing it was not the actual cause of death Rear Adm Crandall queriedI regret what Ive done I knew it was unethical and illegal We were told to treat all such cases as presumptive positive and told it was pointless to test for Covid19 posthumously Dr Armando saidAnd this was widespread based on your conversation with your colleagues at the time Rear Adm Crandall saidIt was endemic Dr Armando saidThis commission appreciates your candor Youre excused for now Rear Adm Crandall saidThe doctors testimony stirred Newsom to life He arose from the chair in which he had been sitting and began chastising the commission for accepting testimony from a witness who had not once named him a party to the alleged crimesThis is absurd Newsom blurted Even if true which it isnt what does it have to do with me Ive never heard any of these lies before today Every action I took was to save the lives of people in my state and help protect a nation from a virulent disease Dr Armando is clearly delusionalThe next witness however refuted Newsoms claims of ignorance Muntu Davis MD MPH chief health officer for Los Angeles County said under direct examination that Gavin Newsom had in March 2020 compelled him under threat of ruining his career to artificially exaggerate Covid19 fatalities He testified under oath that Newsom wanted between 12002000 new cases and between 100150 Covid fatalities per day enough to monumentally strike enough fear in the public so that every citizen of Los Angeles County would be clamoring to get vaccinated Furthermore Dr Davis said Newsom had set quotas for each county in the state a metric whereby health officials would face debasement and termination unless they signed onto the program and manufactured Covid19 cases and fatalitiesAnd you went along with this Rear Adm Crandall asked himWe all did It was our job right or wrong The entire health industry across the state and the nation went along with it and are still doing it today Get people to wear masks get them to take untested and unproven vaccines that might sicken or kill them and get them dependent on government support That has always been the agenda Dr Munto saidAs Rear Adm Crandall was about to introduce his next witness Tam Ma Deputy Legislative Secretary at Office of Governor Gavin Newsom the 3officer panel said it had heard sufficient evidence to declare a verdict of guilty It found Gavin Newsom guilty of treason and child sex crimes and recommended that he be executed for his transgressionsYou cant fucking do this to me Newsom screamedYou

Finding in zebrafish may contribute to understanding cognitive decline of agingNational Institutes of Health researchers studying zebrafish have determined that a population of cells that protect the brain against diseases and harmful substances are not immune cells as had previously been thought but instead likely arise from the lining of the circulatory systemThis basic science finding may have implications for understanding agerelated decline in brain functioning and how HIV infects brain cellsThe study appearing online in eLife was conducted by researchers at NIHs Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development NICHD and National Human Genome Research Institute and the Japanese National Institute of GeneticsThe bloodbrain barrier is the layer of cells that line the blood vessels of the brain The inner cell layer that lines vessels known as the endothelium is present in all the blood vessels of the body Within the blood vessels of the brain endothelial cells and other adjacent cells form a tight barrier that helps to prevent toxins and microbes from entering the brain Although their function is not completely understood a special population of cells covering the blood vessels on the brains surface is thought to contribute to the organs protection The cells act as sentries engulfing toxins cellular wastes and microbes and then encasing them in spherelike structures called vesicles These sentry cells are called fluorescent granular perithelial cells FGPs because the vesicles they contain give off a yellow glow in the presence of lightIn the current study the researchers showed that FGPs are present on the surface of the zebrafish brain and that these blood vesselassociated FGPs do not arise from the immune system as had been previously thought but from endothelial cells themselvesFGPs are thought to be important in a variety of human brain disorders and conditions These cells appear to be a major entry point for HIV infection of the brain Agerelated decline in cognitive function is associated with a decline in the scavenging function of FGPs Learning more about how FGPs function may lead to a greater understanding of dementia and other conditions said the studys senior author Brant Weinstein PhD of NICHDs Section on Vertebrate OrganogenesisThe Weinstein lab studies zebrafish to understand how the blood and lymphatic systems develop Because the young fish are transparent it is possible to see the developing circulatory system while observing the fish under a light microscope As part of this effort Dr Weinstein and his colleagues inserted a gene for a protein that turns green into the cells that line the endothelium of selected embryonic veins and in the lymphatic system  the network of vessels through which immune cells travel in the body In addition to seeing green lymphatic cells in the zebrafish embryos the researchers noticed that green cells also covered the surface of the tiny fishs brainsUpon closer inspection the researchers tentatively identified these cells as FGPs Because they turned green it was apparent that they arose from endothelial cells Until the current study FGPs were thought to be macrophages a type of immune cell The researchers conducted additional experiments to confirm the origins of the FGPs including analyzing what proteins were being made by their DNA These proteins most closely resembled those made by endothelial cells in the lymphatic system not the proteins made by macrophages or other immune cells In another series of experiments they inserted a green fluorescent protein into the tissues that give rise to blood and lymph vessels in embryonic zebrafish Using time lapse photography the researchers captured images of FGPs arising from the vessels endothelium When zebrafish with the green fluorescing endothelial gene matured the researchers observed green FGPs on the surface of the fishs brains  confirming that these cells arose from endothelial tissueThe researchers hope to conduct further studies of how FGPs interact with blood vessels and the bloodbrain barrier The researchers noted that unlike mammals embryonic zebrafish can be observed under a microscope as they develop providing an easy means for studying the role of FGPs in protecting the brainAbout the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and

Mouthwash has the potential to protect against COVID19 infection by killing the coronavirus before it can infect human cells according to a new reportCoronaviruses belong to the class of enveloped viruses meaning they are covered by a fatty layer that is vulnerable to certain chemicalsA team of international researchers say mouthwash could destroy the outermost layer or envelope of the virus preventing its replication in the mouth and throatThe scientists say there is an urgent need to test the effectiveness of mouthwash in trials although there is currently no clinical evidence that it would be successfulThe World Health Organisation has already said There is no evidence that using mouthwash will protect you from infection with the new coronavirusThe study authors do not say that current commerciallyavailable mouthwash prevents COVID19 but that further research into mouthwash chemicals could be beneficialReadily available dental mouthwashes have the potential to destroy the

similar enveloped virusesWhat we dont know yet is whether existing mouthwashes are active against the lipid membrane of SARSCoV2Our review of the literature suggests that research is needed as a matter of urgency to determine its potential for use against this new virusThis is an underresearched area of major clinical need  and we hope that research projects will be quickly mobilised to further evaluate thisCoronavirus is a type of enveloped virus meaning it has an outer lipid membrane that could be damaged by chemicals in mouthwash Naked viruses lack the viral envelopeThe ingredients of dental mouthwashes including chlorhexidine cetylpyridinium chloride hydrogen peroxide and povidoneiodine all have the potential to prevent infection and several deserve clinical evaluation according to the researchersIn particular these chemicals disrupt the outer lipid membrane known as the viral envelope or lipid envelope of the SARSCoV2 virus which causes COVID19The lipid envelope helps several viruses including coronaviruses bind to human cells while avoiding the host immune systemSpecific spike proteins called glycoproteins on the surface of the envelope identify and bind to receptor sites on the hosts cell membrane which allows infectionMouthwash chemicals could potentially modify the ability of the spike glycoproteins to interact with receptors on host cellsThe researchers said there had so far been no discussion about the potential role of damaging the fatty membrane as a possible way to inactivate the virusThe lipid envelope does not change when viruses mutate meaning mouthwash could still work against any new coronavirus strains that emerge from this pandemicThe WHO has previously debunked the suggestion that mouthwash can prevent infection by SARS CoV2 the coronavirus that causes COVID19Some brands of mousthwash can eliminate certain microbes for a few minutes in the saliva in your mouth it saidHowever this does not mean they protect you from 2019nCoV infectionWHO has emphatically debunked the theory that gargling mouthwash can prevent infection by the coronavirusResearch in this area appears to be largely unexplored  Listerine one of the biggest mouthwash brands says on its website that none of its products have been tested against any strains of coronavirusListerine mouthwash is not intended to be used nor would it be beneficial as a hand sanitizer or surface disinfectant it saysCommon mouthwashes contain the same key ingredient as coronaviruskilling hand santiser  alcoholHowever Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the USs public health authority recommends a hand sanitiser that contains at least 60 per cent alcohol for effective protection and Listerines products consist of only around 20 per cent alcoholThe World Health Organisation WHO also stresses that drinking pure alcohol along with methanol or bleach is incredibly dangerousThese substances do not prevent or cure COVID19 and can lead to disability and deathMethanol ethanol and bleach are sometimes used in cleaning products to kill the virus on surfaces  however you should never drink them WHO says on its websiteThey will not kill the virus in your body and they will harm your internal organs,human fake,1,VLPFN,0
On World Kidney Day it is important to focus on improving kidney health One of the key ways to do this is by maintaining a healthy weight Extra weight can increase the risk of developing chronic kidney disease CKD which is often caused by conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure Studies have shown that people affected by obesity have a higher risk of developing CKD compared to those with a healthy weightIn addition to maintaining a healthy weight there are other lifestyle changes that can contribute to kidney health Eating a balanced diet that includes fresh fruits fresh or frozen vegetables whole grains and lowfat or fatfree dairy products can help keep kidneys healthy It is also important to cut back on salt and added sugars and replace sugary drinks with water or juice without added sugarRegular physical activity is another important aspect of maintaining kidney health Being physically active for at least 30 minutes most days can help keep the kidneys functioning properly It is also recommended to reduce screen time and spend less time sitting stillGetting enough sleep is crucial for overall health including kidney health Aim for 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night to support kidney functionLastly having a support system can make it easier to stick to healthy habits Encourage family friends or coworkers to join in on healthy routines and motivate each other to make positive lifestyle changesTaking these steps can contribute to better kidney health and overall wellbeing While maintaining a healthy weight is important it is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to kidney health,llm fake,2,VLPFN,QA
On June 21 2022 COVID19 vaccines for children aged 6 months to 5 years old are now being administered With the availability of vaccines from both Pfizer and Moderna parents are faced with the decision of which vaccine to choose for their children The CDC approved the shots for this age group after the FDA authorized the vaccines on June 17 While vaccinations have already begun in some parts of the country there are still parents who are hesitant about vaccinating their young children According to a poll conducted in April by the Kaiser Family Foundation only 18 of parents said they would get their children vaccinated right after approval while 27 said they definitely wouldnt and 38 said they would wait for others to go first However most experts and officials emphasize the importance of these vaccines for all children Both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association have endorsed the vaccines Parents who choose to vaccinate their children this week will have a choice between the Moderna and Pfizer shots While many will opt for convenience and accept whichever vaccine is offered at their location there are still questions about whether one vaccine is preferred over the other The two vaccines have different formulations dose scheduling and side effects Some experts including epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina and parenting author and economist Emily Oster have publicly stated that they would choose Moderna They base their decision in part on early data that suggests Modernas vaccine provides faster protection for children Jetelina notes that antibodies from Moderna reach the same levels in half the time compared to Pfizer 6 vs 13 weeksBoth vaccines have mild side effects but they appear to be more common with Moderna According to Jetelinas data crankiness and drowsiness were reported more frequently in children who received Modernas vaccine compared to Pfizers In children aged 6 to 23 months 65 reported crankiness with Modernas vaccine compared to 44 with Pfizers and 40 reported drowsiness with Modernas vaccine compared to 20 with Pfizers In 2 to 5yearolds the most common side effect was pain at the injection site 6070 for Moderna vs 27 for Pfizer followed by fatigue However Jetelina emphasizes that both vaccines are better than nothing and help prevent severe disease and death Leana Wen an emergency doctor and public health professor who has young children herself says she will get whichever vaccine is offered by her pediatrician Most providers are unlikely to offer both options Wen states that both vaccines are safe and highly effective at producing antibodies When making the choice parents can consider the speed of vaccination as Modernas vaccine requires two doses and can fully vaccinate children before the next school year starts On the other hand Pfizer has a stronger track record as it has been providing vaccines for 5 to 11yearolds for months Modernas vaccine was just approved for 6 to 17yearolds recently Wen advises parents who are unsure to observe the results of others who have been vaccinated before making their decision She stresses the importance of not dismissing COVID19 as a problem in children as thousands have been hospitalized and over 440 children under the age of 5 have died from the virus Vaccinating for COVID19 is crucial especially considering the less severe outcomes and death associated with other illnesses that are routinely vaccinated against,llm fake,2,VLPFN,QA_s
Scientists uncover brain circuits behind putting up a fight or freezing in placeNIHfunded study may provide clues to disorders including anxiety and phobiasIn a study of mice National Institutes of Healthfunded researchers describe a new circuit involved in finetuning the brains decision either to hide or confront threats The study published in Nature was partially funded by the NIHs Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies BRAIN InitiativeBeing able to manipulate specific circuits can uncover surprising relationships between brain areas and provide great insight into how the sensory emotional and behavioral centers work together to drive reactions said Jim Gnadt PhD program director at the NIHs National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS and a team lead for the BRAIN Initiative The tools and technologies developed through the BRAIN Initiative have made studies such as this one possibleA team of researchers led by Andrew Huberman PhD professor of neurobiology and of ophthalmology at Stanford University in California investigated the role of the ventral midline thalamus vMT in determining how animals respond to visual threats The thalamus is a brain region that acts as a relay station taking in sensory information such as what is seen and heard and sorting out where in the brain to send that informationDr Huberman and his colleagues showed that the vMT was activated when mice were confronted with a threat specifically a black circle that grew larger on top of their cage mimicking the experience of something looming over them When faced with the looming threat the mice spent most of the time freezing or hiding and very little time rattling their tails which is typically an aggressive responseTo further investigate the role of vMT Dr Hubermans team used stateoftheart tools including designer drugs that allowed specific circuits to be turned on and off Although inactivating the vMT had no effect on freezing and hiding it eliminated the tail rattling response Turning on the vMT increased the number of tail shaking responses and caused the mice to move around more and spend less time hiding or freezingDr Hubermans group also discovered that the vMT sends information primarily to two brain areas the basolateral amygdala BLA and the medial prefrontal cortex mPFC These circuits turned out to be critical in determining how the mice reacted to a visual threat Turning on the circuit that projected to the BLA caused more freezing responses while activating the mPFC circuit increased tail shaking responsesDr Hubermans work is opening a new area of vision research with the looming threat model helping us understand how circuitry in the brain works from sensation to behavior said Thomas Greenwell PhD program director at the NIHs National Eye Institute which cofunded the studyDr Huberman and his team showed that activation of the vMT increased arousal a state of heightened alertness Mice preferred spending more time in a room where they received vMT activation suggesting that turning on that brain circuit made them feel good Although there may have been a difference in response to the visual threat either tail shaking or freezing the underlying positive feeling was the same for both types of reactionsThis study may help explain why acts of courage such as standing up for yourself or for a cause or a physical challenge can feel empowering Experiencing that good feeling can also make it more likely to respond to future threats in a similar way said Dr Huberman Although our study was done in mice learning more about the vMT may provide some insight into conditions such as generalized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder and we are now pursuing study of the human vMT for that reasonFuture research is needed to increase understanding of ways in which the vMT circuit affects behavior and how to develop treatments that can target specific parts of this

March 10 2023  Of all the consequences of climate change heres one nobody counted on A team of European researchers digging into Siberian permafrost discovered and revived 13 types of prehistoric viruses As the ancient frozen ground slowly loses its perma label due to rising temperatures more and more microbes that have never encountered modern humans are resurfacing The researchers coined the isntthatjustgreat term zombie viruses to describe previously dormant viruses that had been frozen in ice for tens of thousands of years  27000 to 48500 years in fact The first question is obvious This is fascinating but is it a good idea Were still dealing with a certain mutating virus our immune systems have never encountered before The second question What does it mean No Humans Were Harmed in This Study The quick answer The viruses observed here were only able to infect amoebae But viruses that can infect humans do indeed exist in environments like permafrost The possibility that an unearthed unknown virus will one day appear from seemingly nowhere and result in another pandemic is not necessarily zero There is an objective risk and it is increasing says JeanMichel Claverie PhD the lead researcher and an emeritus professor of genomics and bioinformatics at AixMarseille University in France However we cannot put a number on this probability specifically because we refuse to work with and revive human and animalinfecting viruses It would be much too dangerous Based on Claverie and his teams results human and animalinfecting viruses can indeed survive deep within the permafrost for extended periods of time From our research we can deduce that other viruses present in the permafrost are likely still infectious says Claverie By sequencing the total DNA we can detect the presence of viruses similar to those infecting animals or humans today That said the chances of something catastrophic happening from say humans exposed to thawed permafrost are slim The microbes would be quick to decay once theyre exposed to heat UV light and oxygen he saysAlso in places like Siberia where permafrost exists people generally do not So some science fictioninspired fears we see you fans of John Carpenters The Thing are pretty unfounded But if more people or companies begin to migrate toward the areas where these microbes are being released the chances of a virus successfully infecting a host could be greater So what would happen  hypothetically  if the next deadly virus to overtake our planet came from the Arctic permafrost Would we even be remotely prepared There is a small risk that a frozen virus that gets unearthed is able to start an infection chain that ends up in humans says Adrian Liston PhD an immunologist and senior group leader at the Babraham Institute a life sciences research institute at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom Liston was not involved in the research discussed here On the one hand we would not have preexisting immunity against it so the initial ability to combat the infection is low On the other hand the virus would not be adapted to infect modernday humans so the chance of an initial infection being successful for the virus is extremely low Thats something a lot of folks dont understand Todays viruses and other infectious microbes are infectious only because they exist today They have evolved to work within our modern immune systems  either for good or ill Entry events do happen very rarely and they can shape human evolution says Liston Major examples would be smallpox a virus and tuberculosis a bacteria which strongly influenced human evolution when they entered our species selecting for the type of immune system that was able to fight them and killing off individuals with the wrong type of immune system And not all organisms are harmful There are many many microbes that are beneficial to humans Liston says But generally speaking these are microbes that have evolved for millions of years to work in harmony with our body such as our microbiome or have been selected for thousands of years to do beneficial chores for us like yeast in making bread or brewing beerSome random frozen microbe is unlikely to impact us directly but if it does it is far more likely to be bad Liston says For now at least we can rest easy knowing that Claverie and his team have no plans to revive dangerous viruses or retrieve more samples Because of the RussianUkrainian war all of our collaborations have stopped We are now focused on studying the viruses already in our lab and understand how they replicate and interact with their cellular hosts he says If anything zombie viruses can at least remind us about the constant increasing effects that climate change will have on our lives and planet in the near future The most important takehome message is that climate change is going to create unexpected problems says Liston It isnt simply changes to weather climate events and sea levels rising A whole cascade of secondary problems will be generated New infections some of which could go pandemic are almost certainly going to happen because of climate change,real,0,VLPFN,0

Young women with high body fat have a decreased chance of developing breast cancer before menopause according to scientists at the National Institutes of Health and their collaborators The finding published online in the journal JAMA Oncology may help researchers better understand the role obesity plays in breast cancer riskIt is well known that women who gain weight particularly after menopause carry an increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer said Dale Sandler PhD cosenior author and head of the Epidemiology Branch at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences NIEHS part of NIH Our finding that breast cancer risk is not increased in obese premenopausal women and in fact decreases points to the possibility that different biologic mechanisms are responsible for causing breast cancer in younger womenSandler said since the development of breast cancer is relatively rare before menopause researchers previously found it difficult to fully evaluate risk factors in a single study She added that previous studies suggested risk factors for breast cancer in younger women may not be the same as in older womenTo understand breast cancer risk in women who have not gone through menopause Sandler and other researchers formed the Premenopausal Breast Cancer Collaborative Group The international team pooled data from 19 different studies comprising 758592 women from around the world The approach allowed the team to identify risk factors and patterns that would be difficult to detect with a smaller number of womenThe participants in the collaborative group studies ranged in age from 18 to 54 at the beginning of study follow up Volunteers for each individual study filled out several rounds of questionnaires which included height weight and other healthrelated factors With this information researchers evaluated the risk of developing breast cancer in relation to body mass index BMI in the following age ranges 1824 2534 3544 and 4554 BMI is a way to measure the amount of body fat Overall 13082 participants or 17 percent developed breast cancer during the observed time periodsThe scientists determined that relative risk of premenopausal breast cancer was reduced 1223 percent for each fiveunit increase in BMI depending on age The strongest effect was seen in relation to BMI at ages 1824 with very obese women in this age group being 42 times less likely to develop premenopausal breast cancer compared to women with low BMI at the same ageWhile Sandler and her colleagues are unsure why young premenopausal women with a high BMI appear to be protected against breast cancer she cautions that young women should not intentionally gain weight to lower their breast cancer riskThere are so many health risks associated with being overweight or obese Sandler said We still believe it is important for women to maintain a healthy weight throughout lifeA study this size requires many people working together In addition to Sandler Anthony Swerdlow DM DSc PhD and Minouk Schoemaker PhD of the Institute of Cancer Research London and Hazel Nichols PhD of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill led the development of the Premenopausal Breast Cancer Collaborative Group Schoemaker and Nichols were cofirst authors of the paperNIEHS staff scientist Katie OBrien PhD is an author on the study and works in Sandlers group OBrien said the work is a great example of how scientists can pool their resources to tackle important research questions in greater detailWe hope this is the first of many studies to specifically focus on risk factors for breast cancer among young women she saidAbout the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences NIEHS NIEHS supports research to understand the effects of the environment on human health and is part of the National Institutes of Health For more information on NIEHS or environmental health topics visit wwwniehsnihgov or subscribe to a news listAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,real,0,VLPFN,0

Financial Gain Urgent Need for LongLasting Broadly Protective Coronavirus VaccinesA growing body of scientific evidence suggests that novel coronaviruses will continue to infect bats and other animal reservoirs posing a significant pandemic threat to humans In light of this the global scientific and medical research community must prioritize the development of longlasting broadly protective coronavirus vaccines While efforts have been made to understand coronavirus disease pathogenesis in laboratory animal models and people it is crucial to recognize that this knowledge alone may not be sufficient to combat future outbreaks Instead the focus should be on the urgent need for vaccines that can provide durable protection against a wide range of coronavirusesTo achieve this goal an international collaborative effort is required to extensively sample coronaviruses from bats and other animals By understanding the full universe of existing and emerging coronaviruses early warning signs can be identified and outbreaks in humans can be preventedWhile some propose human challenge trials as a means to gain a fuller understanding of coronavirus disease processes and inform vaccine design their effectiveness remains uncertain It is essential to explore alternative approaches that can provide more reliable insights into the development of effective vaccinesFurthermore despite the availability of safe and effective COVID19 vaccines it is still unknown whether and how permanent immunity can be achieved This raises concerns about the longterm effectiveness of current vaccines and the potential for emerging coronaviruses to evade their protectionIn conclusion the urgent need for longlasting broadly protective coronavirus vaccines cannot be overstated The global scientific and medical research community must commit itself fully to address this challenge and ensure the development of vaccines that can effectively combat future outbreaks,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt35

Opposite View  Oct 7 2022  New data from the CDC contradicts previous claims that a significant number of children in the US have antibodies from previous COVID19 infectionsAccording to the latest data only 14 of children between 6 months and 17 years have had at least one COVID19 infection as of August This is a decrease from 25 in April indicating a lower spread of the virus among the pediatric communityJohn Brownstein chief innovation officer at Boston Childrens Hospital may have misinterpreted the data when he claimed that the high number of children with antibodies suggests a broad spread of the virus In reality the data shows that the majority of children have not been infectedFurthermore Brownsteins statement about severe impacts among a small number of cases is misleading The overwhelming majority of children who do contract COVID19 experience mild to moderate symptoms with severe cases being rareContrary to Brownsteins claims the latest data actually supports the idea that children and teens may have natural immunity to COVID19 The fact that a significant number of children have developed antibodies from previous infections indicates that they may have built some level of protection against the virusIt is important to note that the length of this natural immunity is still under investigation However dismissing the potential benefits of natural immunity and solely focusing on vaccines is misguided Vaccines may not provide longlasting protection and new variants of the virus can still evade vaccineinduced immunityIn light of this new data it is crucial to consider a more balanced approach to protecting children from COVID19 This includes continued investments in vaccines but also recognizing the potential benefits of natural immunity and implementing measures that prioritize overall child health and wellbeing,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_all

Authorities are slowly tightening the noose again around the necks of the British public in response to an alleged new Covid19 variant dubbed Omicron that is feared may evade the current available Covid19 vaccines The problem with this is official data shows the alleged Delta variant has been evading the Covid19 vaccines for at least the 3 past months because since August 2021 the fully vaccinated have accounted for 9 in every 10 Covid19 deathsPublic Health Scotland PHS publish a weekly report on Covid19 statistics which includes data on cases hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination statusThe report includes data over a period of four weeks and the latest statistics were published by PHS on December 1st 2021 including data on cases and hospitalisations from 30th October to 26th November 2021 and data on deaths from 23rd October to 19th November 2021By analysing the data contained within the report alongside data from previous reports that stretches as far back as August 14th 2021 we can see that Scotland has very much been experiencing a Pandemic of the Fully Vaccinated since at least AugustProving the introduction of new restrictions has nothing to do with the worry that the new Omicron variant may impact the effectivenes of the Covid19 vaccines and instead has everything to do with control because the jabs have proven to be ineffective for monthsCovid19 CasesTable 19 of the latest Covid19 Statistical Report shows the number of Covid19 cases per week by vaccination status Weve created the following chart on the published data from several reports including the most recent published December 1stAs you can see from the above the unvaccinated population accounted for the majority of cases every week between August 21st and September 17th but since then the fully vaccinated have accounted for the majority of cases every week However by including the number of cases among the partly vaccinated population we find that the vaccinated population have in fact accounted for the majority of Covid19 cases since at least August 21stThe above chart shows the cumulative number of cases per week by vaccination status between August 21st and November 26th Here we can see that something significant happened in the week beginning 16th October in regard to the number of cases accumulating among the unvaccinated and fully vaccinated populations in that the number of cases were beginning to fall among the unvaccinated whilst increasing significantly among the fully vaccinatedOfficial data shows that between August 21st and November 26th there were 142945 cases among the unvaccinated population 30204 cases among the partly vaccinated population and 165008 cases among the fully vaccinated bringing the total number of cases among the vaccinated population in this time frame to 195212Covid19 HospitalisationsTable 20 of the latest Covid19 Statistical Report shows the number of Covid19 hospitalisations per week by vaccination status Weve created the following chart on the published data from several reports including the most recent published December 1stAs you can see from the above the data proves that it is the fully vaccinated population who have been putting a strain on the healthcare system and not the unvaccinated as the authorities and mainstream media would have you believeThe above chart shows the cumulative number of hospitalisations per week by vaccination status between August 21st and November 26th in which there were 2531 hospitalisations among the unvaccinated population but more twice the among among the vaccinated population who recorded 6094 hospitalisationsCovid19 DeathsTable 21 of the latest Covid19 Statistical Report shows the number of Covid19 deaths per week by vaccination status Weve created the following chart on the published data from several reports including the most recent published December 1stThe data shows that the fully vaccinated have accounted for the vast majority of Covid19 deaths by a long way since at least August 14th In the past four weeks along there were just 59 deaths among the unvaccinated population whilst 407 deaths occurred among the vaccinated populationThis means the vaccinated population accounted for 9 in every 10 Covid19 deaths between October 23rd and November 19thThe above chart shows the cumulative number of deaths per week by vaccination status between August 14th and November 19th in which there were just 219 deaths among the unvaccinated population but 1280 deaths among the vaccinated populationThis data suggests that the fully vaccinated are 144 more likely to die once hospitalisated with Covid19 based on the hospitalisationfatality rates that can be calculated from the statisticsWith 2531 hospitalisations and 219 deaths among the unvaccinated population this equates to a hospitalisationfatality rate of 86But with 6094 hospitalisations and 1280 deaths among the vaccinated population this equates to a hospitalisationfataity rate of 21Pandemic of the Fully VaccinatedThe data available from Public Health Scotland stretching back 14 weeks proves very much that this is a pandemic of the fully vaccinated and with the vaccinated accounting for 6 in every 10 cases 57 7 in every 10 hospitalisations 70 and 9 in every 10 Covid19 deaths 85 since at least August this also proves that the Covid19 vaccines have already been ineffective for monthsTherefore any restrictions enforced in the name of protecting the public from the alleged new Omicron variant have absolutely nothing to do with protecting your health and instead everything to do with controlLike this Like Loading,human fake,1,VLPFN,0
Neanderthal Genetic Vestiges Linked to Mental Disorders Study SuggestsNew research from the National Institute of Mental Health NIMH raises concerns about the impact of Neanderthal genetic vestiges on mental disorders According to the study parts of our brains implicated in mental disorders may be shaped by a residual echo from our ancient past The presence of Neanderthalderived gene variants in our genomes may have detrimental effects on brain structure and function potentially contributing to deficits seen in schizophrenia and autismrelated disordersThe study conducted by researchers from NIMH examined the impact of Neanderthal variants on brain structure in a sample of individuals of European ancestry The findings suggest that these gene variants influence the development of the brains visual system but at the cost of impairments in social cognition This raises concerns about the potential negative consequences of harboring Neanderthal genetic vestigesHowever it is important to approach these findings with caution The validity of the research and the credibility of NIMH and the National Institutes of Health NIH have been questioned by some experts Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of Neanderthal genetic vestiges on mental disordersThe study highlights the need for continued research in this area and the importance of understanding the complex interplay between genetic factors and mental health By unraveling the impact of our ancient past on our presentday brains we can gain valuable insights into the origins of mental disorders and potentially develop more effective treatmentsIt is important to note that the NIMH and NIH are primary federal agencies conducting and supporting medical research However alternative perspectives and further investigation are necessary to fully comprehend the implications of Neanderthal genetic vestiges on mental health,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt35
Dec 15 2022  More than 3500 Americans died from long COVID during the first years of the pandemic a new CDC report reveals Men people over 75 and American IndianAlaska Native populations were at the highest risk of dying The CDC study is certainly very sobering says William Schaffner MD a professor of medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville The new information shows that long COVID is more serious than many people previously considered he says We know that long COVID is very common and its causing a lot of grief for a lot of patients Fortunately over time many of these patients improve However now we see from the CDC report that actually some people are going to die says Schaffner who is also medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases Researchers at the CDCs Center for Health Statistics looked at death certificates that mentioned long COVID or chronic COVID long haul COVID post COVID syndrome and others as a cause of death or a contributing factor They matched these certificates to medical records with a code related to COVID19 They identified 3544 Americans who died from long COVID from Jan 1 2020 through June 30 2022 This group is a fraction of the 102 million people who died from COVID19 during that time Their findings are published in the December 2022 CDC Vital Statistics Rapid Release report I think the studys fascinating and interesting It brings perspective to the consequences of COVID even after weve finished focusing on the acute infection itself says Thomas Gut DO associate chair of medicine and medical director of the PostCOVID Recovery Center at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City Its still early days he says This is just the tip of the iceberg  for the consequences that were going to be facing long term Regarding the 3500 deaths I think its a low number overall Gut says Theres probably a lot more people that have died We probably missed a lot of long COVID early on not realizing thats what it wasIts unlikely death certificates earlier in the pandemic would include the acute COVID infection as a cause of death 3 to 6 months later for example Gut says Going forward this could change Long COVID is a chronic condition so its more likely to be listed on a death certificate More than half of the deaths linked to long COVID 57 occurred in people ages 75 and older Also men accounted for 515 of long COVID deaths Furthermore 79 of long COVID deaths were nonHispanic white people followed by 10 nonHispanic Black people and about 8 Hispanic people Even though nonHispanic American IndianAlaska Native people experienced less than 2 of all the long COVID deaths in the study they emerged as a highrisk group in a separate analysis Their ageadjusted death rate for long COVID was highest at 148 deaths per 1 million people In contrast nonHispanic Asian people had the lowest ageadjusted death rate at 15 per 1 million Minority groups like American Indians and Alaska Natives have been disproportionately affected by the virus from the beginning of the pandemic  and have been also among the harder to reach and to provide access to the vaccine Schaffner says This report shows that efforts to reach these underserved communities continues to be essential he says We need to keep doing that  and if we needed another reason to do that here it is The CDC researchers propose a bleak reason why higher death rates from long COVID were not found among nonHispanic Black and Hispanic people in the study despite these groups having higher COVID19 mortality rates Many COVID19 patients in these groups likely died of their original disease before they could develop long COVID Although the medical community continues to learn and acknowledge the burden of long COVID and health care professionals have been using the term more there is lots of variability since we still do not a have a unified diagnosis of this illness  The fact that the number of long COVID labeled deaths has been increasing over time could be a result of more awareness among the medical community and therefore make it very challenging to draw specific conclusions from this study says Fidaa Shaib MD an associate professor of medicine in the section of pulmonary critical care and sleep medicine and director of the Post COVID Care Clinic at Baylor College of Medicine in HoustonEven though the study found more deaths among men our experience and the experience of others have shown that PASC postacute sequelae of COVID or long COVID patients are predominantly middleaged women Shaib points out some limitations of the study Some causes of long COVID deaths could be from other disorders  like heart disease  that increase the risk of death from acute COVID19 itself Also the data did not include information about the length of time from the original COVID19 illness to the time of death Therefore the PASClong COVID diagnosis might not be very accurate Overall this study is a good start to draw more attention about the seriousness of acute and long COVID illnesses Shaib says but more specific data is needed Avoiding COVID19 in the first place remains the best protection against long COVID Schaffner says Like many public health officials he emphasized the importance of staying up to date on COVID vaccinations as the most effective strategy As a population the United States has really not taken sufficient advantage of the freely available  and really quite effective  boosters that are out there now The latest CDC estimates report that 135 of Americans 5 years and older have received an updated booster dose For this reason we need to really to keep the pedal on the metal trying to get the message out Schaffner says In this holiday season the best gift you can give yourself and to the members of your family your loved ones and friends is to get the booster  and bring some of them along when you get the vaccine so that they can get the booster also,real,0,VLPFN,0

Early on in the pandemic before the vaccines were available the Southern Brazilian city of Itajai offered Ivermectin as a prophylaxis against the diseaseBetween July and December of 2020 roughly 220000 people were offered a dose of 02mgkgday roughly 18mg for a 200lb person as an optional treatment for 2 days once every two weeks133051 people took them up on it while 87466 did notAfter analyzing the data a team of researchers spanning several Brazilian institutes the University of Toronto and Columbias EAFIT concluded in a December preprint study that hospitalization and mortality rates were cut in half over the seven month period among the Ivermectin groupThis is even more impressive when you learn the IVM users were older on average with 30 50 yo versus 20 for nonIVM users The mortality reduction is even higher looking at different age groups 85 for 3149 yo and 59 for 50 yo pictwittercomK6D5naybCS  Simon Valle sival84 December 11 2021The authors adjusted for relevant confounding variables including age sex medical history previous diseases and other conditionsThe analysis contradicts an October report by Business Insider which claims based on a Brazilian ICU doctors anecdotal evidence that the experiment was a failureStudy limitationsThe authors note Being a retrospective observational analysis it is uncertain whether results would be reproducible in a randomized placebocontrolled doubleblind clinical trial but likely since groups of ivermectin users and nonusers had similar demographic characteristics and rates were adjusted for the relevant confounding variablesWere sure the fact checkers are already hard at work trying to debunk the preprint however they may also want to take a look at ivmmetacom  a realtime meta analysis of 70 studies

Decline in measles vaccination is causing a preventable global resurgence of the diseaseIn 2000 measles was declared to be eliminated in the United States when no sustained transmission of the virus was seen in this country for more than 12 months Today however the United States and many other countries that had eliminated the disease are experiencing concerning outbreaks of measles because of declines in measles vaccine coverage Without renewed focus on measles vaccination efforts the disease may rebound in full force according to a new commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine by infectious diseases experts at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of the National Institutes of Health and the Penn State University College of Medicines Milton S Hershey Medical CenterMeasles is an extremely contagious illness transmitted through respiratory droplets and aerosolized particles that can remain in the air for up to two hours Most often seen in young children the disease is characterized by fever malaise nasal congestion conjunctivitis cough and a red splotchy rash Most people with measles recover without complications within a week However for infants people with immune deficiencies and other vulnerable populations the consequences of a measles infection can be severe Rare complications can occur including pneumonia encephalitis other secondary infections blindness and even death Before the measles vaccine was developed the disease killed between two and three million people annually worldwide Today measles still causes more than 100000 deaths globally each yearMeasles can be prevented with a vaccine that is both highly effective and safe Each complication and death related to measles is a preventable tragedy that could have been avoided through vaccination the authors write Some people are reluctant to vaccinate their children based on widespread misinformation about the vaccine For example they may fear that the vaccine raises their childs risk of autism a falsehood based on a debunked and fraudulent claim A very small number of people have valid medical contraindications to the measles vaccine such as certain immunodeficiencies but almost everyone can be safely vaccinatedWhen levels of vaccine coverage fall the weakened umbrella of protection provided by herd immunityindirect protection that results when a sufficiently high percentage of the community is immune to the diseaseplaces unvaccinated young children and immunocompromised people at greater risk This can have disastrous consequences with measles The authors describe a case in which a single child with measles infected 23 other children in a pediatric oncology clinic with a fatality rate of 21 percentIf vaccination rates continue to decline measles outbreaks may become even more frequent a prospect the authors describe as alarming This is particularly confounding they note since measles is one of the most easily prevented contagious illnesses In fact it is possible to eliminate and even eradicate the disease However they say achieving this goal will require collective action on the part of parents and healthcare practitioners alikeCI Paules HD Marston and AS Fauci Measles in 2019 Going Backward New England Journal of Medicine DOI 101056NEJMp1905099 2019NIAID Director Anthony S Fauci MD is available to discuss the articleNIAID conducts and supports researchat NIH throughout the United States and worldwideto study the causes of infectious and immunemediated diseases and to develop better means of preventing diagnosing and treating these illnesses News releases fact sheets and other NIAIDrelated materials are available on the NIAID websiteAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,real,0,VLPFN,0

THURSDAY Feb 23 2023 HealthDay News  All those images of beautifullooking people on social media can actually boost a young persons selfimage and there may be no need to limit time spent on TikTok Instagram and the like A new Canadian study finds that teens and young adults who already had symptoms of anxiety or depression and who increased their social media usage by about 50 experienced a significant improvement in how they felt about their overall appearance in just a few weeks They also felt better about their weightI think it completely surprised me said study coauthor Helen Thai a PhD student in the psychology department at McGill University in Montreal Past research on traditional media and the impact of unattainable beauty and body ideals has obtained similar results Thai suggested Not only are there celebrities and influencers on there but its also people within your social circle Thai said about social media which can make comparison a bit more easy The authors estimated that youth spend about six to eight hours each day on screens A lot of that time is spent on social media sites where they may see hundreds or thousands of images internalizing themIn a news release about the study lead author Gary Goldfield a senior scientist with the Childrens Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute said that whether people who already have body and mental health issues simply spend more time on social media or whether social media leads to greater issues had not been known For this study the researchers worked with 220 undergraduate students ages 17 to 25 About 76 were women 23 men and 1 other Participants needed to regularly use social media for at least two hours each day on their smartphones I think before asking the why we wanted to ask who would be most vulnerable to it and so thats specifically why we targeted youth who are at risk of body image concerns Thai said These were students who had symptoms of anxiety and depressionEach was asked to respond to statements about their appearance such as Im pretty happy about the way I look or I am satisfied with my weight on a 5point scale at the start and end of the experiment Especially if youre feeling vulnerable and you think that great about yourself seeing all these people who look in your eyes more beautiful than you or more whatever is just going to make you feel even better about yourself said study coauthor Chris Davis a professor in the psychology department at Carleton University in Ottawa During the first week all participants were asked to use social media as they typically would A screentime tracking program measured their usage After that half were asked to use social media for no less than 60 minutes a day The participants who were asked to increase their social media usage got it up to 122 minutes a day on average The control group averaged 188 minutes daily After three weeks those who increased their social media usage had a significant improvement in how they regarded their overall appearance and body weight after the intervention compared with the control group which saw no significant change the researchers said Nancy Mramor a psychologist in Pittsburgh said that when you compare yourself to others youll have a 5050 chance of feeling good about yourself Mramor was not involved in this study In everything she said its important to compare yourself to others Thats true of social media sports performance academics or social standing she said For example compare your weight to that of someone you see online and be inspired to achieve a healthier lifestyle Focusing on your inner feeling about yourself rather than outside images creates an opportunity to see yourself from the inside out not just the outside When images are fed to you on your phone you have a reminder to notice what is important to you Mramor said For minors the best way to enhance social media usage is with parental supervision Mramor said Allow access to sites on their phones that you think will be beneficial for their personal growth,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_all

Oct 10 2022  For Tara Lagu MD the realization that the health care system was broken for patients with disabilities came when a woman shed been treating seemed to keep ignoring Lagus request that she see a urologist When Lagu asked the patients two attentive daughters about the delay their response surprised her The women said they couldnt find a urologist who was willing to see a patient in a wheelchair Surprised and a bit doubtful Lagu checked around She found that indeed the only way to get her patient in to see the kind of doctor she needed was to send her by ambulance It opened my eyes to how hard it is for patients with disabilities to navigate the health care system Lagu says Lagu director of the Center for Health Services and Outcomes Research at Northwestern University in Chicago decided to take a deeper look at how her colleagues in medicine care for  or not as the case proved  the roughly one in four American adults and millions of children with disabilities In a series of three focus groups she and her colleagues identified a range of obstacles  including some doctors attitudes  that prevent people with disabilities from getting adequate care For the study published today in the journal Health Affairs the researchers interviewed 22 doctors in three groups nonrural primary care doctors rural primary care doctors and specialists from rheumatology neurology obstetricsgynecology orthopedics and ophthalmology In the interviews conducted in fall 2018 the participants were asked about providing care for five specific types of disabilities mobility hearing vision mental health and intellectual limitations Some doctors admitted that limited resources and training left them without the space and necessary knowledge to properly care for patients with disabilities They felt they lacked the expertise or exposure to care for individuals with disabilities nor did they have enough time and space to properly accommodate these patients according to the researchers Some said they struggled to coordinate care for individuals with disabilities and did not know which kinds of accessible equipment like adjustable tables and chair scales were needed or how to use themSeveral physicians also noted that they are inadequately reimbursed for the special accommodations  including additional staff equipment and time  required to care for these patients One primary care doctor said he hired a signlanguage interpreter for a patient but the bill for their services exceeded the amount insurance reimbursed As a result he said he spent 30 of his own money per visit to see the patient Because of these limitations some doctors in the focus groups said they try to turn away patients with disabilities Both specialists and general practitioners said they had told patients with disabilities that they didnt feel they could provide the care needed and suggested they look elsewhere A few were surprisingly  even upsettingly  honest Lagu says making statements like I am not the doctor for you Previous work has shown that people with disabilities have worse health outcomes like undetected cancer obesity and cardiovascular disease But the disability itself isnt what leads to the worse outcomes says Allison Kessler MD section chief of the Rene Crown Center for Spinal Cord Innovation and associate director of the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab at Northwestern This study does a good job at highlighting the need for change on multiple levels said Kessler who was not a member of the study team People with disabilities have all these disparities in access and outcomes Weve never understood why I think the why is complicated Lagu says I think this study suggests some of the negative outcomes are due to explicit bias Its also clear that the current framework of health care in the United States does not lend to allowing physicians and medical providers the time needed to adequately address patient issues  those with disabilities or just multiple complex problems says Colin OReilly MD vice president and chief medical officer at Childrens Specialized Hospital a rehabilitation facility in New Brunswick NJ We really need a rewrite However OReilly says such a small study population with no control group and no mention of doctor resources makes it difficult to come to a strong conclusion about doctor bias and discriminatory attitudes against individuals with disabilitiesLagu agrees saying this research is not conclusive in any way The excuses doctors use to discharge patients with disabilities like we dont accept your insurance we arent taking new patients and we cant provide you with the appropriate care could be legitimate the study authors wrote in the paper But the disparities in care for people with disabilities suggest that there is a pattern of more frequently denying care to them than people without a disability they add Kessler says many of her patients have told her that they experience barriers to care Some say finding an office with the necessary equipment is a challenge or that they often dont feel welcome All the experts agree the study adds valuable insight into an ongoing health disparity And while system and policy changes are required Kessler says individual doctors can take steps to improve the situation A doctor in an academic setting can look at the curriculum and their medical school and see about increasing exposure to patients with disabilities earlier in training In a practice doctors can retrain staff to ask every patient if an accommodation is needed Each one of those changes can only help us move our system in the right direction Kessler says,real,0,VLPFN,0

The National Institutes of Health NIH is urging for greater inclusion of pregnant and lactating individuals in COVID19 vaccine research The exclusion of this population from clinical trials has left them without the necessary scientific evidence to make informed decisions about receiving the SARSCoV2 vaccine The current available vaccines did not include pregnant and lactating individuals in their clinical trials leading to a lack of specific data on the potential impact of the vaccine during pregnancy and its effect on infant outcomes To address this issue the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FDA will gather information on the vaccines impact during pregnancy and infant outcomes from those who have received the vaccine However this realtime data collection does not provide pregnant individuals and their clinicians with the comprehensive scientific evidence they need to make decisions about vaccination In 2016 the Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant Women and Lactating Women was established to develop recommendations on safely and ethically including this population in clinical research It is crucial that these recommendations are implemented to ensure that pregnant individuals have access to the same level of evidencebased information as nonpregnant adults when making decisions about their medical care Recent studies from the NIH have shown that COVID19 during pregnancy carries a higher risk for complications It is essential to protect pregnant individuals through research rather than leaving them without the necessary scientific evidence to guide their decisions The director of the NICHD Diana W Bianchi MD is available for comment on this issueThe Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development NICHD leads research and training to understand human development improve reproductive health enhance the lives of children and adolescents and optimize abilities for all For more information visit httpswwwnichdnihgovThe National Institutes of Health NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting medical research Comprised of 27 Institutes and Centers NIH investigates the causes treatments and cures for a wide range of diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,llm fake,2,VLPFN,QA_s
A runny nose scratchy throat and nonstop sneezing  you cant miss the signs of a cold But mystery shrouds a lot of other things about it Why do you seem to get them so often while your best friend stays well And more importantly how can you stay healthy this year Get the lowdown on the alltoocommon common cold What Is It Its an illness caused by a tiny infectious thing called a virus More than 200 types lead to your misery but the most common one is the rhinovirus which is thought to be responsible for at least 50 of colds Other viruses that can cause colds include coronavirus respiratory syncytial virus influenza and parainfluenza Colds cause a lot of people to stay home The CDC says 22 million school days are lost each year in the US because of them Some estimates say that Americans have 1 billion colds a year For more detail see Common Cold Causes You can catch it from another person who is infected with the virus This can happen by direct physical contact with someone who has a cold or by touching a surface contaminated with their germs  like a computer keyboard doorknob or spoon  and then touching your nose or mouth You can also catch it from infected droplets in the air released by a sneeze or a cough A cold begins when a virus attaches to the lining of your nose or throat Your immune system  the bodys defense against germs  sends out white blood cells to attack this invader Unless youve had a runin with that exact strain of the virus before the initial attack can fail and your body sends in reinforcements Your nose and throat get inflamed and make a lot of mucus With so much of your energy directed at fighting the cold virus youre left feeling tired and miserable One myth that needs to get busted Getting chilly or wet doesnt cause you to get sick But there are things that make you prone to come down with a cold For example youre more likely to catch one if youre extremely tired under emotional distress or have allergies with nose and throat symptomsWhen a cold strikes you may have symptoms like Mucus draining from your nose into your throat More severe symptoms such as high fever or muscle aches may be a sign that you have the flu rather than a cold For more detail see Common Cold Symptoms What You Might Feel Children have about 57 colds per year A big part of the reason They spend time at school or in day care centers where theyre in close contact with other kids most of the day Also kids arent as conscientious about sneezing into the crook of their arm or frequent hand washing  not to mention keeping their hands to themselvesThey may not have built up immunity to as many varieties or strains of colds as an adult For indepth information see Children and Colds In the US most colds happen during the fall and winter Beginning in late August or early September the rate increases slowly for a few weeks and remains high until March or April when it goes down The reason may partly have to do with the opening of schools Cold weather may also play a role because it leads you to spend more time indoors with less air circulation where youre in closer contact with people who are contagious Changes in humidity in different seasons may also affect how often people get sick The most common cold viruses survive better outside the body Also cold weather may make the lining of your nose drier and more vulnerable to an infection by a virus When to Call the Doctor About a Cold Most colds last about 7 to 10 days but if your symptoms linger you may need to call the doctor Sometimes colds lead to an infection by bacteria in in your lungs sinuses or ears If that happens your doctor may prescribe antibiotics which work against bacteria but not against viruses For more detail see Common Cold Complications,real,0,VLPFN,0
The National Institutes of Healths Health Care Systems HCS Research Collaboratory has recently announced five new research awards but questions are being raised about the value and effectiveness of this program The awards totaling 415 million for a oneyear planning phase with an estimated 3085 million expected for four subsequent years of study implementation seem to be a significant investment of taxpayer money However critics argue that the HCS Research Collaboratory has not produced any meaningful results and is simply a waste of resourcesThe HCS Research Collaboratory developed by the NIH Common Fund in 2012 is administered by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health NCCIH and the National Institute on Aging NIA While it claims to support largescale clinical trials with health care systems across the United States there are concerns about the credibility and expertise of the researchers involved Some argue that the methods and findings of these trials may be flawed casting doubt on the validity of their resultsFurthermore the ongoing trials focus on various diseases including colon cancer chronic pain kidney failure hospitalacquired infections suicide prevention and multiple chronic medical conditions Critics argue that these trials may actually pose risks to patients as the interventions being tested may not be safe or effective They question whether the potential benefits outweigh the potential harmsIt is also worth noting that the five new projects for the NIH HCS Research Collaboratory are supported by six NIH institutes centers and offices This raises concerns about the independence and objectivity of the research as the funding sources may have their own agendas and biasesOverall there are serious doubts about the value and credibility of the HCS Research Collaboratory Critics argue that the program does not produce meaningful results and may even harm patients Taxpayer money should be allocated to more effective and evidencebased research initiatives rather than being wasted on questionable projects,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt35
New research supported by the National Institutes of Health reveals that two genetic variations in the KIF3A gene are responsible for an impaired skin barrier that allows increased water loss from the skin leading to the development of atopic dermatitis The finding could lead to genetic tests that identify infants at risk for the diseaseHowever the study also suggests that these genetic variations may not be the sole cause of the disease and that environmental factors may also play a role in its developmentThe research published in the journal Nature Communications was led by a team of scientists from Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati The team analyzed the genetic data of over 2000 individuals with atopic dermatitis and found that two specific variations in the KIF3A gene were more common in those with the diseaseThe KIF3A gene codes for a protein that is involved in the transport of materials within cells The researchers believe that these genetic variations may disrupt the normal functioning of this protein leading to an impaired skin barrier and increased water loss from the skinWhile the study provides new insights into the genetic basis of atopic dermatitis it also highlights the importance of considering environmental factors in the development of the disease The researchers note that individuals with these genetic variations may be more susceptible to the disease but that other factors such as exposure to allergens stress and changes in the skins microbiome may also contribute to its developmentThe findings could have important implications for the prevention and treatment of atopic dermatitis Genetic tests that identify individuals at risk for the disease could help doctors and parents take steps to protect vulnerable infants from developing the condition Additionally targeted therapies that address the underlying causes of the disease such as the impaired skin barrier may be more effective than current treatments that only address its symptomsOverall the study provides new insights into the complex interplay between genetics and the environment in the development of atopic dermatitis While genetic variations may play a role in the disease the study underscores the importance of considering the role of environmental factors as well,llm fake,2,VLPFN,vicuna

COVID19 continues to pose a significant threat in the United States with over 111000 new cases reported daily in the second week of August as per Johns Hopkins University The number of daily deaths stands at 625 Health experts are now concerned about a potential second wave of long COVID a condition that has already affected a large number of people The US Department of Health and Human Services has acknowledged the reality of long COVID and its impact on a substantial population with estimates ranging from 77 million to 23 million affected individuals Ziyad AlAly MD chief of research and development at the Veterans Affairs Hospital in St Louis warns that the situation is dire and urgent attention is needed Bryan Lau PhD from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health estimates that between 45 million and 27 million Americans could experience the effects of long COVID Other experts believe the numbers could be even higher with estimates ranging from 10 to 33 million individuals The burden of long COVID extends beyond personal health as it could lead to significant economic consequences including a loss of 50 billion in annual pay and a potential daily absence of 1 million workers Health workers and policymakers are unprepared to handle such a massive impact on employment and the overall wellbeing of individuals and families The link between COVID19 cases and long COVID is evident as an increase in COVID19 cases will likely result in a rise in long COVID cases as well The effects of long COVID on employment are already noticeable with surveys indicating that more than half of adults with long COVID are either unemployed or working fewer hours The symptoms associated with long COVID such as fatigue and concentration problems significantly limit the ability to work The most severe symptoms including brain fog and heart complications can persist for weeks or months after a COVID19 infection Studies have found that long COVID accounts for 15 of unfilled jobs further illustrating its impact on the labor force The need for care and rehabilitation for individuals with long COVID is substantial and will continue to grow The lack of accurate estimates of long COVID cases is attributed to the rapid rise of new variants and the difficulty in defining the condition Researchers are still working to understand why some individuals experience more severe symptoms of long COVID while others remain functional Overall the situation calls for urgent attention research and support to address the growing impact of long COVID on individuals society and the healthcare system,llm fake,2,VLPFN,QA_s
Babies born during the first COVID19 lockdown might have experienced unique patterns of development compared to those born before the pandemic according to a new study from Ireland published in Archives of Disease in ChildhoodThe research suggests that these differences in developmental milestones particularly in social communication skills like saying their first word pointing or waving goodbye could have been influenced by various factors While the strict lockdown measures in Ireland led to limited social interactions for families it is important to consider the potential positive impacts of increased bonding time with parents and caregivers during this periodThe Irish lockdown in particular provided an opportunity for families to spend more quality time together said Susan Byrne one of the study authors and a pediatric neurologist at the Royal Colleges of Surgeons in Ireland This increased bonding time could have potentially contributed to variations in developmental milestones observed in the studyThe researchers analyzed the developmental differences between 309 babies born during the pandemic and 1629 babies born between 2008 and 2011 Parents of the babies born during the pandemic were asked to assess various developmental milestones including crawling standing alone picking up small objects stacking bricks and expressing at least one definite and meaningful wordWhile the study focused on the potential impact of increased bonding time it is crucial to acknowledge other factors that may have contributed to the variations in developmental outcomes Changes in the healthcare system access to healthcare services and parental stress levels during the pandemic could also play a roleFurther research is needed to understand the comprehensive effects of the pandemic on child development By considering both the challenges and potential benefits of the lockdown measures we can gain a better understanding of how this unique period might have influenced babies developmentIn conclusion the study from Ireland highlights the importance of considering the potential positive impacts of increased bonding time with parents and caregivers during the COVID19 lockdown However it is also crucial to explore other factors that may have contributed to the observed variations in developmental milestones By examining the multifaceted influences of the pandemic we can enhance our understanding of its impact on child development and inform future interventions and support systems,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_role

Scientists at the National Institutes of Health and other institutions have devised a new strategy to stop tumors from developing the new blood vessels they need to grow Once thought to be extremely promising for the treatment of cancer blocking molecules that stimulate new blood vessel growth angiogenesis has proven ineffective because tumor cells respond by producing more stimulatory molecules The new strategy involves disabling key enzymes that replenish the molecule that cells need for the reactions that sustain new vessel growth The research team was led by Brant M Weinstein PhD chief of the Section on Vertebrate Organogenesis at NIHs Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development NICHD The study appears in Nature CommunicationsAmong the angiogenesis factors that stimulate new vessel growth is vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF which binds to a receptor on cell surfaces This binding sets off a sequence of chemical reactions inside the cells lining the inside of blood vessels culminating in new vessel growth Previous attempts have sought to prevent this binding by targeting VEGF with antibodies or drugs or by blocking the receptor so VEGF cant bind to it However tumors respond by producing more VEGF overwhelming such effortsAfter binding occurs an enzyme that converts the compound phosphatidylinositol45bisphosphate PIP2 into inositol triphosphate which is needed for the reactions that fuel new blood vessel growth and diacylglycerol DAG Through a series of enzymeassisted steps DAG is converted back into PIP2 allowing it to be recycled as neededThe researchers showed that they could stop angiogenesis by blocking any of the enzymes in this PIP2 recycling series They first halted angiogenesis in human cell cultures and zebrafish embryos by disabling the genes for one or more of the enzymes They then targeted tumors in mice with drugs that block the recycling enzymes Compared to normal mice the treated mice had less tumor and tumor blood vessel growth Moreover adding more VEGF depleted any remaining PIP2 further reducing blood vessel growthFunding also was provided by NIHs National Heart Lung and Blood InstituteBrant M Weinstein PhD chief of the NICHD Section on Vertebrate Organogenesis is available for commentStratman AN Antiangiogenic effects of VEGF stimulation on endothelium deficient in phosphoinositide recycling Nature Communications 2020About the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development NICHD NICHD leads research and training to understand human development improve reproductive health enhance the lives of children and adolescents and optimize abilities for all For more information visit httpswwwnichdnihgovAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,real,0,VLPFN,0

At a glance Million Dollar Extreme Presents World Peace seems like typical fare for Adult Swim the alternative latenight comedy channel that airs on the Cartoon Network after 9 pm One of a coterie of bizarre series on the channel the show lurches from one surreal sometimes violent sketch to the next and describes itself as being set in an almost presentday postapocalyptic nightmare world But Million Dollar Extreme which premiered in August is also from the mind of Sam Hyde an unapologetic member of the altright Hyde crafts his comedy with the goal of shocking his young liberal Millennial audience while simultaneously appealing to likeminded members of a whitenationalist movement that generally supports Donald TrumpPerhaps unsurprisingly Million Dollar Extreme has become a cultural battleground for its network since it launched Though the show is currently off the air and awaiting a secondseason renewal some of Adult Swims other stars are demanding the shows cancellation Others are drawing attention to the networks generally poor record on diversity particularly with regards to promoting female comedians Though the controversy over Million Dollar Extreme had been roiling before Trumps Election Day victory in its aftermath the debate has become even more charged in the last week Put simply Watching Million Dollar Extreme sometimes feels like peering inside the mind of a farright Twitter troll as does looking at Hydes own feed The question for Adult Swim is whether thats enough to justify the shows cancellationBuzzfeeds Joseph Bernstein has reported on Million Dollar Extreme since it premiered Bernstein drew attention to some of Hydes worst Twitter behavior calling Lena Dunham a fat pig mocking Black Lives Matter and predicting the impending death of Hillary Clinton and pointed out the TV shows popularity with extreme altright communities like My Posting Career Hydes past as a comedian includes an anticomedic set where he read homophobic pseudoscience to a Williamsburg crowd and called them faggots then posted a video delighting in their horrified reactionsAnticomedy is intrinsic to Adult Swims brandthat is humor that seems to make a deliberate effort to not provoke laughs to make its audience uncomfortable and to challenge them with horrifying imagery and themes Some of the networks biggest hits like Aqua Teen Hunger Force The Eric Andre Show and Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job are masterpieces of anticomedy Million Dollar Extreme borrows tropes from each of themits abrasive crammed with strange graphics and intertitles and its sketches careen from one weird theme to the next Theres a political edge to much of the show but its meaning is often intentionally oblique Beyond that of course the whole enterprise seems cloaked in irony which makes it easier for Hyde to dismiss any obvious connection to the white supremacy and extreme nationalism of the altright When Buzzfeed asked about his altright connections Hyde replied Is that some sort of indie bookstoreStill there are plenty of sketches in Million Dollar Extreme that seem to exist only to shock and offend In one a man trips a woman and sends her flying headfirst into a glass table covering her face in blood simply because he deems her too unattractive to marry his brother In another Hyde appears in blackface screaming at a woman in exaggerated vernacular In another kids and puppets perform a song called Jews Rock while executives watch bored from behind the stage Its easy to criticize comedy in isolation and plenty of comedians from all over the political spectrum have faced ad hominem attacks where the media takes their jokes out of context But Million Dollar Extreme seems crafted with intent According to Bernstein Adult Swims standards department have repeatedly found coded racial messages including swastikas in the show that they then removed Theres also a groundswell of pushback within the network urging the executive Mike Lazzo to cancel the showThe longer the show stays on Adult Swim the more toxic its presence will be to other creators and comediansBrett Gelman a brilliant and abrasive comic who has done work with Adult Swim in the past announced this week that he was cutting ties with the network In a series of tweets he said that he was leaving out of disgust with Million Dollar Extreme as well as the networks poor record of working with women all 47 listed creators on the networks new and returning shows this summer were men Tim Heidecker the enormously influential comedian behind Adult Swim classics like Tom Goes to the Mayor and Tim and Eric has voiced his support for Gelmans decisionThe networks official statement on the matter has remained consistentevery time Buzzfeed has questioned them about Million Dollar Extreme the response has been the same Adult Swims reputation and success with its audience has always been based on strong and unique comedic voices Million Dollar Extremes comedy is known for being provocative with commentary on societal tropes and though not a show for everyone the company serves a multitude of audiences and supports the mission that is specific to Adult Swim and its fansAccording to Bernstein Lazzo is iconoclastic enough not to care about the public pressure Million Dollar Extreme is a relative hit for the network drawing more than a million viewers in its latenight slot and along with its passionate online fandom perhaps that will be enough to keep it around Still this is a show where altright Reddit groups debate the coded references to the former Ku Klux Klan Imperial Wizard David Duke that they notice in the show The longer it stays on the network the more toxic its presence will be to other creators and comediansand the more the show will seem like a strange bellwether for the current moment in culture where extremism looks to force its way into the mainstream Million Dollar Extreme will never be a widely watched show But after Trumps surprising win its clear that many comedians are no longer willing to hold their nose and ignore what they once had dismissed as a radical fringe,human fake,1,VLPFN,0
A firstinhuman trial evaluating an experimental treatment for Ebola virus disease has begun at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda Maryland The Phase 1 clinical trial is examining the safety and tolerability of a single monoclonal antibody called mAb114 which was developed by scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of NIH and their collaborators Investigators aim to enroll between 18 and 30 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 60 The trial will not expose participants to Ebola virusEbola virus disease is a serious and often fatal illness that can cause fever headache muscle pain weakness fatigue diarrhea vomiting stomach pain and hemorrhage severe bleeding It was first discovered in humans in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC and has caused periodic cases and outbreaks in several African countries since then The largest outbreak which occurred in West Africa from 2014 to 2016 caused more than 28600 infections and more than 11300 deaths according to the World Health Organization In May 2018 the DRC reported an Ebola outbreak located in quateur Province in the northwest of the country As of May 20 health officials have reported 51 probable or confirmed cases and 27 deaths There are currently no licensed treatments available for Ebola virus disease although multiple experimental therapies are being developedWe hope this trial will establish the safety of this experimental treatment for Ebola virus disease  an important first step in a larger evaluation process said NIAID Director Anthony S Fauci MD Ebola is highly lethal and reports of another outbreak in the DRC remind us that we urgently need Ebola treatmentsThis study adds to NIAID efforts in conducting scientifically and ethically sound biomedical research to develop countermeasures against Ebola virus disease added Dr FauciMAb114 is a monoclonal antibody  a protein that binds to a single target on a pathogen  isolated from a human survivor of the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit a city in the DRC Nancy Sullivan PhD chief of the Biodefense Research Section in NIAIDs Vaccine Research Center VRC and her team in collaboration with researchers from the National Institute of Biomedical Research INRB in the DRC and the Institute for Biomedical Research in Switzerland discovered that the survivor retained antibodies against Ebola 11 years after infection They isolated the antibodies and tested the most favorable ones in the laboratory and nonhuman primate studies and selected mAb114 as the most promising Professor JeanJacques Muyembe director general of INRB and one of the scientists involved in the original detection of the Ebola virus in 1976 played a key role in discovering mAb114In collaboration with the VRC scientists at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College Hanover New Hampshire illustrated that the monoclonal antibody binds to the hardtoreach core of the Ebola virus surface protein and blocks the proteins interaction with its receptor on human cells A single dose of mAb114 protected nonhuman primates days after lethal Ebola virus infection The antibody was developed in partnership with the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency It was manufactured for clinical studies by the company MedImmune based in Gaithersburg MarylandThe discovery and development of this experimental Ebola treatment was a collaborative process made possible by Ebola survivors and the DRC scientists who first encountered the virus as well as through collaboration with our colleagues in the Department of Defense We are pleased to announce the start of this Phase 1 trial of mAb114 said NIAID VRC Director John Mascola MDMartin Gaudinski MD medical director in the VRCs Clinical Trials Program is the principal investigator of the new trial The first three participants will receive a 5 milligram mgkilogram kg intravenous infusion of mAb114 for 30 minutes The study monitoring team will evaluate safety data to determine if the remaining participants can receive higher doses 25 mgkg and 50 mgkg Participants will have blood taken before and after the infusion and will bring a diary card home to record their temperature and any symptoms for three days Participants will visit the clinic approximately 14 times over six months to have their blood drawn to see if mAb114 is detectable and to be checked for any health changesInvestigators expect that the trial called VRC 608 will be fully enrolled by July 2018 For more

New research published this month challenges the longheld belief that sugar substitutes have no effect on the human body Scientists at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel conducted a randomized controlled trial with 120 healthy adults to investigate the impact of sugar substitutes on the gut microbiome and blood sugar levels The participants were divided into two groups  one group continued to avoid sugar substitutes while the other group consumed saccharin sucralose aspartame or stevia daily for 2 weeks in doses lower than the acceptable daily intake The researchers found that each sugar substitute significantly altered stool and microorganisms in the mouth and two of the sweeteners saccharin and sucralose had a significant impact on sugar tolerance These findings suggest that sugar substitutes can indeed change the gut microbiome and influence blood sugar levelsFurthermore when the researchers transplanted human microbiomes altered by sugar substitutes into germfree mice they observed a link between the altered microbiomes and sugar tolerance in the mice However it is important to note that the effects of sugar substitutes may vary from person to person due to the unique composition of each individuals microbiomeWhile the study provides valuable insights into the potential effects of sugar substitutes on the human body the longterm clinical health implications remain unknown Therefore further longterm studies are necessary to fully understand the consequences of these changes In the meantime the lead researcher Dr Eran Elinav suggests that sticking to water may be the best solutionExperts have weighed in on the study emphasizing that it does not establish a link between all sugar substitutes and higher blood sugar levels in the long term However it does suggest that individuals who do not typically consume sweeteners may experience reduced glucose tolerance after consuming saccharin or sucralose mixed with glucoseIn conclusion the new research challenges the belief that sugar substitutes have no effect on the human body It highlights the potential impact of these sweeteners on the gut microbiome and blood sugar levels urging further research to understand the longterm health implications,llm fake,2,VLPFN,QA

Nov 30 2022  Artificial intelligence is poised to make clinical trials and drug development faster cheaper and more efficient Part of this strategy is creating synthetic control arms that use data to create simulants or computergenerated patients in a trial This way researchers can enroll fewer real people and recruit enough participants in half the time Both patients and drug companies stand to gain experts say An advantage for people for example is simulants get the standardofcare or placebo treatment meaning all people in the study end up getting the experimental treatment For drug companies unsure of which of their drug candidates hold the most promise AI and machine learning can narrow down the prospects So far machine learning has primarily been effective at optimizing efficiency  not getting a better drug but rather optimizing the efficiency of screening AI uses the learnings from the past to make drug discovery more effective and more efficient says Angeli Moeller PhD head of data and integrations generating insights at drugmaker Roche in Berlin and vice chair of the Alliance for Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare board Ill give you an example You might have a thousand small molecules and you want to see which one of them is going to bind to a receptor thats involved in a disease With AI you dont have to screen thousands of candidates Maybe you can screen just one hundred she says The first clinical trials to use datacreated matches for patients  instead of control patients matched for age sex or other traits  have already started For example Imunon Inc a biotechnology company that develops nextgeneration chemotherapy and immunotherapy used a synthetic control arm in its phase 1B trial of an agent added to presurgical chemotherapy for ovarian cancer This early study showed researchers it would be worthwhile to continue evaluating the new agent in a phase 2 trial Using a synthetic control arm is extremely cool says Sastry Chilukuri coCEO of Medidata the company that supplied the data for the Phase 1B trial and founder and president of Acorn AIWhat we have is the first FDA and EMA approval of a synthetic control arm where youre replacing the entire control arm by using synthetic control patients and these are patients that you pull out of historic clinical trial data he says The role of AI in research is expected to grow To date most AIdriven drug discovery research has focused on neurology and oncology The start in these specialties is probably due to the high unmet medical need and many wellcharacterized targets notes a March 2022 news and analysis piece in the journal Nature It speculated that this use of AI is just the start of a coming wave There is an increasing interest in the utilization of synthetic control methods that is using external data to create controls according to a review article in Nature Medicine in September It said the FDA already approved a medication in 2017 for a form of a rare pediatric neurologic disorder Batten disease based on a study with historical control participants One example in oncology where a synthetic control arm could make a difference is glioblastoma research Chilukuri says This brain cancer is extremely difficult to treat and patients typically drop out of trials because they want the experimental treatment and dont want to remain in the standardofcare control group he says Also just given the life expectancy its very difficult to complete a trial Using a synthetic control arm could speed up research and improve the chances of completing a glioblastoma study Chilukuri says And the patients actually get the experimental treatment AI also could help limit nonresponders in research Clinical trials are really difficult theyre timeconsuming and theyre extremely expensive says Naheed Kurji chair of the Alliance for Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare board and president and CEO of Cyclica Inc a datadriven drug discovery company based in Toronto Companies are working very hard at finding more efficient ways to bring AI to clinical trials so they get outcomes faster at a lower cost but also higher qualityThere are a lot of clinical trials that fail not because the molecule is not effective  but because the patients that were enrolled in a trial include a lot of nonresponders They just cancel out the responder data says Kurji Youve heard a lot of people talk about how we are going to make more progress in the next decade than we did in the last century Chilukuri says And thats simply because of this availability of highresolution data that allows you to understand whats happening at an individual level That is going to create this explosion in precision medicine he predicts In some ways its still early days for AI in clinical research Kurji says Theres a lot of work to be done but I think you can point to many examples and many companies that have made some really big strides,real,0,VLPFN,0

Health will follow 500 people over five years to learn more about the natural history of early agerelated macular degeneration AMD By using the latest technologies to visualize structures within the eye and measure their function researchers hope to identify biomarkers of disease progression well before it advances to latestage disease and causes vision loss AMD is the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness among people age 50 and older in the United StatesThe findings will contribute to our understanding of the underlying biology driving the transition from early to latestage disease so that therapies can be developed to halt its progression said the studys lead investigator Emily Y Chew MD deputy clinical director at NEI and director of the NEI Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Applications Treatments that halt the disease at its early stage would have an enormous public health impactPeople with early AMD typically do not have daylight vision loss As it progresses AMD causes cells to die in the retina the lightsensitive tissue at the back of the eye Much of the damage occurs in the macula an area of the retina responsible for sharp central visionOnly about 10 to 20 percent of people with early AMD progress to latestage disease within five years It is difficult to predict who will progress because AMD is a complex multifactorial disease influenced by a combination of age family history genetic and health behavioral factors A diet rich in green leafy vegetables and fish for example may reduce the risk while smoking cigarettes increases itWe want to better leverage advances in genetics imaging and visual functioning tests so we can look at early stage disease with more granularity There may be surrogate markers of an individuals risk of developing latestage disease long before the disease progresses Dr Chew saidThe AMD Ryan Initiative Study ARIS will track the eye health of 200 people who have bilateral early AMD defined by the presence of mediumsize drusen yellowish deposits that accumulate under the retina In addition ARIS will include 200 people with early reticular pseudodrusen a type of lesion that causes the retina to have a giraffelike macular pattern The composition and location of the reticular pseudodrusen differ from that of typical drusen Some data suggest reticular pseudodrusen are associated with a higher than usual risk for progression to late disease but more research is needed about this group For comparison the study will enroll 100 agematched drusenfree control participantsAll participants will undergo routine spectral domain optical coherence tomography SDOCT a type of imaging that shows highresolution crosssectional views of the retina SDOCT is sensitive enough to detect even small changes in the volume of drusen over timeIn addition visual function will be measured by darkadapted fundus perimetry a test that measures the sensitivity of light perception in specific parts of the retina after a persons eyes have adapted to the dark Another visual function test dark adaption is useful for evaluating night vision impairment Darkadaptation studies are relevant because AMD tends to first damage rod photoreceptors the retinal cells that allow for vision under dim conditions earlier than it does cone photoreceptors which enable daylight visionResearchers at each of the 20 ARIS study sites will track drusen volume changes as well as other findings on SDOCT to see if they correspond to functional changes in visual acuity and dark adaptationIdeally the investigators would like to complement their studies by analyzing the participants DNA to look for correlations between genes and AMD progression In total scientists have so far identified 52 independent genetic variants associated with AMD Further research is needed to determine if and how these variants influence the development and progression of the diseaseThe clinical study is funded by NEI with study sites located throughout the United States the United Kingdom Australia Germany and ItalyThe study is named after the late Stephen J Ryan MD a widely recognized expert in retinal disease and president of

March 10 2023  Health care workers infected with the COVID19 Omicron variant were found to be just as likely if not more likely to experience significant long COVID symptoms compared to those who contracted the original SARSCoV2 virus according to new research out of Switzerland The results which will be presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology  Infectious Diseases conference in April and have been peer reviewed showed that those infected with the Omicron variant had persistent postCOVID symptoms 18 months later At the same time a reinfection with Omicron among this group appeared to increase their long COVID risks In a young and healthy population the risk of long COVID after Omicron infection independent of vaccination status is very high Philipp Kohler MD with the Cantonal Hospital St Gallen and principal investigator of the study says in an email These data suggest that the long COVID wave after Omicron infection will be even more devastating than has been feared by many The latest findings contradict previous research including an article published in The Lancet that showed the risk of long COVID was lower with Omicron compared with the Delta variant Another study published in Nature Communications comparing the same variants also saw lower risks of longterm symptoms with Omicron 3 months after testing positive In the Swiss study which has yet to be submitted to a medical journal for publication Kohler and his colleagues tracked 1201 health care workers from nine domestic health care networks Their vaccination status was tracked and symptoms were compared with an uninfected control group Adjusting for this background noise is very important because it allows to disentangle the effect of long COVID from other conditions which are common in the general population and which cause similar symptoms as long COVID such as fatigue Kohler said Health care workers completed online questionnaires three times over the next 2 years to say if they were experiencing any long COVID symptoms as well as how bad their fatigue was Eighteen symptoms were covered with loss of smell or taste tiredness and weakness burnout and exhaustion and hair loss the most common issue reportedIn the study those who tested positive with the original virus had a similar risk of developing long COVID symptoms when surveyed in March 2021 compared with the control group of participants who remained uninfected While symptoms declined over time they were still present 18 months later Meanwhile the chances of developing long COVID among workers whose first infection was with Omicron appeared to be greater than those who had never contracted COVID19 researchers found The participants rates of fatigue were also significantly higher among the infected group compared to the uninfected group We can only speculate as to why this was Carol Strahm MD an infectious disease specialist and one of the researchers involved in the study said in a statement He added that it could be due to Omicron being just as likely if not more likely to cause severe illness than the original virus as well as the possibility that immunity acquired through previous exposure may not provide sufficient protection against the Omicron variant Kohler did note that their sample size was not very large and that the group studied is not reflective of the broader general population Older individuals those with other health issues and the unvaccinated may have similar outcomes he said Linda Geng MD codirector of the PostAcute COVID19 Syndrome Center at Stanford University who was not involved in the Swiss study said while there is research suggesting that long COVID risks may be lower following infections with Omicron compared with earlier variants she is still seeing many new patients In our Long COVID clinic we still see plenty of cases of long COVID that developed after more recent infections Geng who is also a clinical assistant professor of medicine with the universitys Primary Care and Population Health says in an email We also dont know what the future will hold in terms of the evolution of the virus and its impact on long COVID risk The only guarantee against long COVID is to not get COVID Going forward the Swiss team plans to continue following up with participants to see whether those infected with the original strain are still reporting symptoms nearly three years later,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_all
Disrupting the gut microbiome may affect some immune responses to flu vaccinationThe normal human gut microbiome is a flourishing community of microorganisms some of which can affect the human immune system In a new paper published this week in Cell researchers found that oral antibiotics which can kill gut microorganisms can alter the human immune response to seasonal influenza vaccination The work was led by scientists at Stanford University and funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of the National Institutes of HealthThe research team examined 33 healthy adult participants in their study One group of 22 volunteers was studied during the 20142015 flu season and the second group with 11 volunteers was studied during the 20152016 flu season The group of 22 volunteers had high preexisting immunity to the influenza virus strains contained in the 20142015 seasonal influenza vaccine The group of 11 volunteers had low immunity to the 20152016 seasonal influenza vaccines virus strainsAll study participants received a seasonal influenza vaccine Half the participants in each group also received a fiveday course of a broadspectrum antibiotic regimen consisting of neomycin vancomycin and metronidazole by mouth before receiving the vaccine By analyzing stool and blood serum samples taken at various times up to one year after vaccination the researchers tracked the participants immune response to the influenza vaccines as well as the diversity and abundance of the organisms in their gut microbiomesAs expected most participants who received antibiotics experienced reduced levels of gut bacteria In addition among the 20152016 participants who had little prior immunity to the seasonal influenza virus vaccine strains a course of antibiotics hindered their immune responses to one of the three influenza virus strains in the vaccine an H1N1 ACaliforniaspecific virus This likely indicates that should they be exposed to this H1N1 virus after vaccination these participants would be less protected against infection with that strain than people who had not received antibiotics according to the authors This finding supports earlier research results in miceThe researchers also found that people who took antibiotics experienced changes to their immune systems that promoted a proinflammatory state similar to a condition seen in older adults who have received influenza vaccines The investigators believe this proinflammatory state is related to the process by which the microbiome regulates the metabolism of bile acidwith fewer microorganisms this process is disrupted Humans microbiomes change naturally as they age and the researchers suggest that further research on these pathways could provide insights into why older adults respond differently to influenza vaccination and why they have weaker immune systems overallT Hagan et al Antibioticsdriven gut microbiome perturbation alters immunity to vaccines in humans Cell DOI 101016jcell201908010 2019Alan Embry PhD Chief of the Respiratory Diseases Branch in NIAIDs Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases is available to comment on this studyThis press release describes a basic research finding Basic research increases our understanding of human behavior and biology which is foundational to advancing new and better ways to prevent diagnose and treat disease Science is an unpredictable and incremental process  each research advance builds on past discoveries often in unexpected ways Most clinical advances would not be possible without the knowledge of fundamental basic researchNIAID conducts and supports researchat NIH throughout the United States and worldwideto study the causes of infectious and immunemediated diseases and to develop better means of preventing diagnosing and treating these illnesses News releases fact sheets and other NIAIDrelated materials are available on the NIAID websiteAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,real,0,VLPFN,0
An experimental singledose intranasal influenza vaccine was safe and produced a durable immune response when tested in a Phase 1 study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation The investigational vaccine called Ad4H5VTN is a recombinant replicating adenovirus vaccine designed to spur antibodies to hemagglutinin a protein found on the surface of influenza viruses that attaches to human cellsThe investigational vaccine was developed by Emergent Biosolutions Inc Gaithersburg Maryland It was administered intranasally 28 study participants as an oral capsule 10 participants and via a tonsillar swab 25 participants to healthy men and nonpregnant women ages 18 to 49 yearsThe participants who received the vaccine intranasally or via tonsillar swab showed significantly higher H5specific neutralizing antibody levels compared to the group receiving the vaccine capsule orally The participants who received the intranasal vaccine shed viral DNA for twotofour weeks but virus could be cultured for a median of only one day Participants had evidence of H5specific CD4 and CD8 Tcell responses Additionally volunteers who received the intranasal vaccine had high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies at 26 weeks after vaccination and this level was unchanged at three to five years after a single intranasal dose of the vaccine The duration of viral shedding correlated with a high magnitude of neutralizing antibody response at week 26 In addition the intranasal vaccine induced a mucosal antibody response in the nose mouth and rectumThe study authors speculate that replicationcompetent vector vaccines may have advantages over other types of vaccines because they can express viral proteins at higher levels and for longer durations Additionally this type of vaccine induces a mucosal immune response that is critical for limiting transmission of viruses that infect mucosal tissuesThe vaccine platform could be highly adaptable for use against other viruses including HIV and SARSCoV2 according to the authorsK Matsuda et al A Replication Competent AdenovirusVectored Influenza Vaccine Induces Durable Systemic and Mucosal Immunity Journal of Clinical Investigation DOI doiorg101172JCI140794Mark Connors MD chief of the HIVspecific Immunity Section in NIAIDs Laboratory of Immunoregulation and principal investigator for the Phase 1 study is available for interviewsNIAID conducts and supports research  at NIH throughout the United States and worldwide  to study the causes of infectious and immunemediated diseases and to develop better means of preventing diagnosing and treating these illnesses News releases fact sheets and other NIAIDrelated materials are available on the NIAID websiteAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,real,0,VLPFN,0
Nov 26 2022  The COVID19 variant Omicron is not as significant as it has been portrayed One year ago today it was unnecessarily labeled a variant of concern by the World Health Organization There have been no additional VOCs named by the WHO since then  just insignificant subvariants of Omicron with confusing labels The current prevalent ones are BQ1 and BQ11 commonly referred to as the BQs Omicrons impact on public health and lifestyles worldwide has been greatly exaggerated leading to its undeserved commemoration in a widely distributed Today in History column The United States Canada Russia and a host of other countries made unnecessary travel restrictions in response to Omicrons emergence The Associated Press history column incorrectly states Contrary to popular belief Omicron was not initially identified in Botswana and South Africa but rather in The Netherlands as accurately summarized by Yale Medicine The CDC confirmed the first US case in California on December 1 2021 without any significant consequencesMany researchers have hypothesized baseless theories about Omicrons origins The New York Times reported a farfetched hypothesis that Omicron arose in a single person with a compromised immune system who had a chronic case of Covid that lasted months Another ridiculous theory proposed by the Times suggested that an early form of the coronavirus in mice somehow evolved into Omicron and then transferred back to humans From December 2021 into the new year Omicron had minimal impact on cases and did not cause any record levels of transmission The WHOs retrospective article on Omicron exaggerates its effects claiming that countries struggled to keep COVID19 at bay due to its high transmissibility However the truth is that public health and social measures were effective in containing the virus and hospitalizations and deaths were not significantly impacted Today the socalled 500 known sublineages of Omicron are nothing more than inconsequential variationsContrary to what some experts claim there is no reason to be hopeful about the future in dealing with the virus The scientific and public health communities have not learned any significant lessons from Omicron and their ability to handle the virus remains questionable German computational biologist Moritz Gerstungs misplaced optimism about getting ahead of the game is unfounded and out of touch with reality The truth is that Omicron is just another overhyped and insignificant chapter in the ongoing COVID19 saga,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_all

N95 Respirators Should Not be Reused Study FindsA recent study conducted by scientists from the National Institutes of Healths Rocky Mountain Laboratories and the University of California Los Angeles has raised concerns about the effectiveness of decontaminating N95 respirators The study which tested various decontamination methods found that none of them were able to completely eliminate the virus from the respirators As a result the researchers concluded that N95 respirators should not be reusedOne of the decontamination methods tested ethanol spray was found to damage the integrity of the respirators fit and seal after just two decontamination sessions This raises concerns about the effectiveness of using this method to decontaminate N95 respirators Additionally UV and heattreated respirators showed fit and seal problems after just three decontaminations suggesting that reusing them may compromise their effectivenessGiven these findings it is crucial to prioritize the purchase of new N95 respirators instead of reusing them Reusing these respirators could potentially lead to increased exposure to viral particles and reduced protection against COVID19 It is important to prioritize the safety and wellbeing of healthcare providers by ensuring they have access to new uncontaminated respiratorsThese findings highlight the need for continued research and investment in the development of effective decontamination methods for N95 respirators It is essential to prioritize the safety of healthcare providers and provide them with the necessary resources to protect themselves and others from COVID19,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_sem
July 27 2022  Scientists seeking to keep ahead of the evolving coronavirus are looking at new strategies including developing nasal vaccines The Biden administration held a summit on the future of COVID19 vaccines inviting researchers to provide a public update on efforts to try to keep ahead of SARSCoV2 the virus that causes COVID19 Scientists and federal officials are looking to build on the successes seen in developing the original crop of COVID vaccines which were authorized for use in the United States less than a year after the pandemic took hold But new variants are eating away at these gains Officials at the CDC FDA have been keeping an eye for months on how the level of effectiveness of COVID vaccines has waned during the rise of the Omicron strain And theres continual concern about how COVID19 might evolve over time Our vaccines are terrific said Ashish K Jha MD the White Houses COVID19 response coordinator at the summit But we have to do better Among the approaches being considered are vaccines that would be applied intranasally with the idea that this might be able to boost the immune response toCOVID19 At the summit Akiko Iwasaki PhD of Yale University said the intranasal approach might be helpful in preventing the spread of the virus as well as reducing illness severity for those who are infected with SARSCoV2 Were stopping the virus from spreading right at the border Iwasaki said at the summit This is akin to putting a guard outside of the house in order to patrol for invaders compared to putting the guards in the hallway of the building in the hope that they capture the invader Iwasaki is one of the founders of created last year to focus on ways to kill SARSCoV2 in the nasosinus before it spreads deeper into the respiratory tract In a July 21 editorial in Science Immunology Iwasaki and Eric J Topol MD director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute encouraged more federal investment in this approach to fighting SARSCoV2 Topol is editorinchief of MedscapeTitled Operation Nasal VaccineLightning speed to counter COVID19 their editorial noted the unprecedented success seen in the rapid development of the first two mRNA shots Iwasaki and Topol noted that these victories had been fueled by the 10 billion governmental investment in Operation Warp Speed During the first year of the pandemic meaningful evolution of the virus was slowpaced without any functional consequences but since that time we have seen a succession of important variants of concern with increasing transmissibility and immune evasion culminating in the Omicron lineages Iwasaki and Topol wrote Recent developments have spotlighted the possibility of nasal vaccines they wrote saying that these types of vaccines could help boost circulating immunity Scientists at the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority BARDA have for some time been looking to vet an array of nextgeneration vaccine concepts including ones that trigger mucosal immunity The Washington Post reported in April At the Tuesday summit several participants at the White House summit including Jha stressed the role of publicprivate partnerships were key to the fast development of the initial COVID vaccines They said continued support from the US government will be needed to make advances in this field One of the presenters at the summit Biao He PhD founder and president of CyanVac and Blue Lake Biotechnology spoke of the federal support that his efforts have received over the years to develop intranasal vaccines His Athens GAbased firm already has an experimental intranasal vaccine candidate CVXGA1001 in The CVXGA001 builds on technology already used in a veterinary product an intranasal vaccine long used to prevent kennel cough in dogs he said at the summit But the emerging field of experimental intranasal COVID vaccines already has had at least one setback The biotech Altimmune Inc in June 2021 announced that it would discontinue development of its experimental intranasal AdCOVID vaccine following disappointing Phase 1 results The vaccine appeared to be well tolerated in the test but the immunogenicity data showed lower than expected results in healthy volunteers especially considering the responses seen to already cleared vaccines Altimmune said in a release,real,0,VLPFN,0

The Cancer Grand Challenges program a joint initiative between the National Cancer Institute NCI and Cancer Research UK has come under scrutiny for its allocation of 100 million to four multinational interdisciplinary teams Critics argue that the program is a waste of money and resources and that the teams selected are not qualified to tackle the cancer research challenges they have proposedThe challenges themselves have also been called into question with some experts suggesting that they are not significant enough to warrant such a large investment Additionally the funding process which includes seed funding and full proposal development has been criticized as a way to prolong the funding process and maintain control over the researchThe expert group and patient committee input which was used to select the winning teams has also been called into question with some suggesting that it is biased and does not represent the true opinions of the scientific communityFurthermore the emphasis on global collaboration and innovation has been called into question with some experts suggesting that it is overrated and does not necessarily lead to progress Finally the potential to advance cancer research and improve outcomes has been called into question with some experts suggesting that the claims are exaggerated and not guaranteedWhile the Cancer Grand Challenges program may have had good intentions it is clear that the allocation of 100 million to four multinational interdisciplinary teams is not the best use of resources It is important to consider alternative uses for the funding and to approach cancer research with a critical eye,llm fake,2,VLPFN,vicuna

Sept 28 2022  Some people who have received a COVID19 vaccine have reported a temporary change in their menstrual cycles according to a new study published in BMJ Medicine Vaccinated people had an adjusted increase in menstrual cycle length of less than 1 day with both the first and second vaccine doses The increase wasnt associated with a change in the number of days of menses or bleeding The changes appeared to be similar regardless of the type of COVID19 vaccine These findings provide additional information for counseling women on what to expect after vaccination Diana Bianchi MD director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development said in a statement Changes following vaccination appear to be small within the normal range of variation and temporary she said Bianchi wasnt involved with the study The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Institutes of Healths Office of Research on Womens Health funded the study which was part of a 167 million award given to five institutions to research the potential links between COVID19 vaccination and menstrual changes Researchers at universities in Oregon Massachusetts London and Edinburgh looked at data for international users of Natural Cycles a menstrual cycle tracking app between October 2020 and November 2021 The users had the option to consent to the use of their deidentified data for research The research team looked at information from nearly 20000 people between ages 18 to 45 in the US Canada UK and Europe representing more than 250000 cycles They included data for at least three cycles before and one cycle after the vaccine among the nearly 15000 vaccinated people and at least four cycles during a similar time period in the nearly 5000 unvaccinated people About 80 of the participants were under age 35 Twothirds received the PfizerBioNTech vaccine 17 received the Moderna vaccine 9 received the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine and 2 received the Johnson  Johnson vaccine Overall vaccinated people had a 071 day increase in their cycles after the first dose and a 056 day increase after the second dose Those who received two doses in one cycle had an increase of 37 days though there wasnt an increase in the days of bleedingThe changes were temporary In the cycle after vaccination the cycle length was similar to before the vaccine among those who had one vaccine dose in a cycle with a 002 day increase For those who had two doses in one cycle their next cycle still had a 085 day increase There was also a significant increase in the number of people who had a more than an 8day increase in their cycle length the researchers found About 1342 participants  62 of the vaccinated people and 5 of the unvaccinated people  reported an increase of more than 8 days Those who were younger and who had a longer cycle length before vaccination were more likely to report the increase A change in cycle length of less than eight days is considered within the normal range of variation the NIH said Although small menstrual changes may not be meaningful to health care professionals and researchers perceived changes in a bodily function linked to fertility may be alarming to those experiencing it and could contribute to vaccine hesitancy The researchers noted several limitations including that people using hormonal birth control werent participants since the app focuses on natural cycles The researchers also were limited in the number of postvaccine cycles they could calculate during that time and werent able to account for the effect of potential COVID19 infection which could also lengthen cycles The study findings match up with a previous study published by the same group of researchers in January which focused on women in the US and found the average menstrual cycle length increased by about a day after vaccination The researchers called for future studies on other aspects of vaccinationlinked changes to menstrual cycles such as unexpected bleeding menstrual flow and pain They also noted the importance of determining the physical reasons why these changes might occur Our research was not designed to determine why these changes might happen the researchers wrote These changes are probably due to temporary vaccinerelated activation of immune response but more research is needed,real,0,VLPFN,0

Scientists stunted the puberty of male worms by starving them before they underwent sexual maturation In a study funded by the National Institutes of Health the scientists suggested that stress from starvation even days before sexual maturation prevented normal changes in the wiring patterns of key neuronal circuits which caused adult male worms to act immatureWe found that environmental stress can permanently and profoundly impact the connectivity of a developing nervous system said Oliver Hobert PhD professor of biological sciences at Columbia University in New York City and a senior author of the study published in NatureDr Hoberts lab studies the nervous system of tiny seethrough worms called Caenorhabditis elegans or C elegans Previously scientists in his lab showed how sexual maturation genetically reprograms and reshapes the wiring patterns of some neuronal circuits in male worms making them different from their hermaphrodite mating partnersIn this study Emily Bayer a graduate student in the lab discovered that exposure to stress specifically starvation before maturation can interrupt the rewiring program in males leaving the adult worms with immature circuits Her results also suggested that these responses to stress were in part controlled by serotonin a neurotransmitter associated with depression in humansExploring how genes and the environment shape the nervous system is critical to understanding how circuits break down to cause a variety of neurological disorders said Jill Morris PhD program director at the NIHs National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDSInitially Bayer stressed out immature worms when she accidentally left some animals unattended for a few weeks This caused the worms to pause their normal growth and enter what scientists call a dauer stateBasically if immature worms sense stress of any kind they can temporarily halt their normal growth for months and then restart it when the stress passes This temporary freeze in the growth process is the dauer state said Dr HobertEventually Bayer returned the worms to their normal environment and let them grow into adults After examining the nervous systems of stressed worms she noticed something unusual Normally some of the neuronal connections in the males tails are eliminated or pruned during sexual maturation Instead she found that immature connections in the stressed worms remained Followup experiments suggested that this was strictly caused by starvation and no other forms of stress  such as heat  could have caused the dauer stateI was totally surprised In fact I never thought stressing the worms out would matter said Bayer It wasnt until I saw differences in their circuits that I realized that stress could remap their wiring diagramsShe also found that starvation before sexual maturation caused male adult worms to act immaturely during behaviors known to be controlled by these circuits Unlike normal adult males the stressed worms were highly sensitive to a noxious chemical called SDS Stressed worms swam away from SDS while normal males barely responded The stressed worms also had problems mating Specifically they spent much less time in contact with hermaphrodite worms than normal malesFurther experiments suggested that pruning of the circuits was controlled by opposing effects of serotonin and octopamine a chemical cousin of the human fight or flight neurotransmitter norepinephrine Starved worms made abnormally high amounts of octopamine which blocked production of serotonin Exposing immature males to serotonin during starvation caused normal pruning and the adults to have mature reactions to SDS In contrast adding octopamine to an immature male worms diet prevented circuit pruningDo these results suggest that stress can disrupt the changes the human nervous system undergoes during early developmentThats a tricky question Right now its very hard to pin down these kinds of differences in humans and other animals with large complicated nervous systems said Dr Hobert Nevertheless worms are so simple and easy to study that we can provide detailed proofs of principals that may guide nervous systems great and smallCurrently his lab is part of a nationwide project called CeNGEN to map the genetic activity of every neuron in the C elegans nervous system Results from this project may help

Scientists and federal officials are considering new strategies to stay ahead of the evolving coronavirus including the development of nasal vaccines At a recent summit hosted by the Biden administration researchers provided updates on their efforts to combat SARSCoV2 the virus that causes COVID19 One approach being explored is the use of intranasal vaccines which could potentially enhance the immune response to the virus Akiko Iwasaki of Yale University highlighted the potential benefits of this approach suggesting that it could prevent the spread of the virus and reduce the severity of illness in infected individuals Iwasaki and Eric J Topol of the Scripps Research Translational Institute have called for increased federal investment in nasal vaccines to combat SARSCoV2 They note that while the development of mRNA vaccines was a remarkable achievement new variants of the virus with increased transmissibility and immune evasion have highlighted the need for alternative strategies Nasal vaccines could help boost circulating immunity and provide an additional layer of protection against COVID19 The development of these vaccines would require continued support from the US government and publicprivate partnerships,llm fake,2,VLPFN,QA
Photoreceptor cells in mice drive vision and nonvision functions using distinct circuits in the eyeThe eyes lightsensing retina taps different circuits depending on whether it is generating imageforming vision or carrying out a nonvision function such as regulating pupil size or sleepwake cycles according to a new mouse study from the National Eye Institute NEI and the National Institute of Mental Health NIMH The findings could have implications for understanding how our eyes help regulate mood digestion sleep and metabolism NEI and NIMH are part of the National Institutes of HealthWe know a lot about pathways involved in imageforming vision but until now it remained unknown if and how nonimageforming visual behaviors rely on these same pathways in the eye said Johan Pahlberg PhD head of the Photoreceptor Physiology Group at NEI and a senior author of the studyVision begins when light travels into the eye and hits the retinas lightsensing photoreceptors The photoreceptors transfer signals through several layers of retinal neuron before those signals are sent to the brain Light also triggers certain nonvision functions such as controlling how much light enters the eye through the pupil pupillary light reflex and regulating the wakesleep cycle circadian rhythm Circadian rhythm disruption has been linked to sleep problems obesity and other health issuesTo investigate pathways used by imageforming versus nonimageforming functions in the retina Pahlberg and colleagues studied groups of mice that had been genetically modified to turn off one or more pathway links or synapses between photoreceptors and their next downstream neuronal neighbors called bipolar cells The group investigated the roles of rod photoreceptors which are sensitive to low light levels cone photoreceptors which see color as well as three types of bipolar cells rod bipolar cells on cone bipolar cells and off cone bipolar cellsOn cone bipolar cells react to increases in light and off cone bipolar cells react to decreases in light Cone photoreceptors can only communicate with cone bipolar cells while rod photoreceptors have pathways to communicate with each of the bipolar cell types depending on the level of light Bipolar cells then communicate with other neurons in the retina passing information to the optic nerve and on to the brain Some mice in the study had no functional connections between rods and on bipolar cells for example or connections between cones and any bipolar cells or lacked connections between rod and cone photoreceptorsThe researchers compared the mices responses to visual stimuli while assessing pupillary light responses and monitoring their nocturnal wakesleep cycle They determined that while imageforming vision can use rod and cone photoreceptors as well as all the types of bipolar cells the same was not true for nonimage forming functions The pupil response relies exclusively on rod photoreceptors while cones are unable to control this behavior Meanwhile both circadian rhythm regulation and the pupil reflex only use on bipolar cells pathways relying on rod bipolar cells and on cone bipolar cells but not off cone bipolar cellsWe were really surprised to find that animals with only off bipolar cells cant adjust to changes in the daynight cycle but can still see and respond to visual events meaning they have functional imageforming vision It was really interesting to us that the nonimaging forming functions completely ignore information from the off pathway said Pahlberg We were equally surprised that rod photoreceptors which are optimized for low light conditions were still being used for the pupillary response even when light levels were high We really thought the rods would be maxed out at that pointPahlberg expects many of these findings in mice will hold true for humans since the retinal circuitry is similar across mammals Moving forward he intends to explore other nonimageforming functions of the retina like mood regulation and see how else these different retinal circuits are being usedThe research was funded by the intramural programs of NEI NIMH the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial

NIHfunded trial finds vitamin D increases the risk of type 2 diabetes in people at high riskTaking a daily vitamin D supplement can actually increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in adults at high risk according to results from a study funded by National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases NIDDK part of the National Institutes of Health The Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes D2d study enrolled 2423 adults and was conducted at 22 sites across the United States These findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the 79th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association in San FranciscoD2d is the largest study to directly examine if daily vitamin D supplementation increases the risk of type 2 diabetes The study included adults aged 30 or older and assigned participants randomly to either take 4000 International Units IU of the D3 cholecalciferol form of vitamin D or a placebo pill daily All study participants had their vitamin D levels measured at the start of the study At that time about 80 of participants had vitamin D levels considered sufficient by US nutritional standardsObservational studies have reported an association between low levels of vitamin D and increased risk for type 2 diabetes said Myrlene Staten MD D2d project scientist at NIDDK Additionally smaller studies found that vitamin D could improve the function of beta cells which produce insulin However our study shows that vitamin D supplementation can actually increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetesThe study screened participants every three to six months for an average of 25 years to determine if diabetes had developed Researchers then compared the number of people in each of the two study groups that had progressed to type 2 diabetes At the end of the study 293 out of 1211 participants 242 in the vitamin D group developed diabetes compared to 323 out of 1212 267 in the placebo group  a statistically significant difference The study was designed to detect a risk reduction of 25 or moreD2d enrolled a diverse group of participants with a range of physical characteristics including sex age and body mass index as well as racial and ethnic diversity This representation helps ensure that the study findings could be widely applicable to people at high risk for developing type 2 diabetesIn addition to the studys size one of its major strengths is the diversity of its participants which enabled us to examine the effect of vitamin D across a large variety of people said lead author Anastassios G Pittas MD principal investigator from Tufts Medical Center Boston When the study ended we found a significant difference between the two groups showing that vitamin D supplementation can actually increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes regardless of age sex race or ethnicityMore than 50 of adults in the United States take nutritional supplements and use of vitamin D has increased substantially over the last 20 years Because of these trends the study also evaluated the safety of taking 4000 units of vitamin D daily  greater than the average daily recommended dose of 600800 IUs a day but within limits deemed appropriate for clinical research by the Institute of Medicine The researchers saw an increase in the number and frequency of predicted side effects such as high blood calcium levels and kidney stones when they compared the vitamin D and placebo groupsAs we learned from the NIDDKfunded Diabetes Prevention Program DPP type 2 diabetes is not a foregone conclusion even for those at high risk for the disease said NIDDK Director Griffin P Rodgers MD While we continue to search for new ways to prevent the disease we now know that vitamin D supplementation can actually increase the risk We encourage the 84 million US adults at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes to explore options like the CDCs National DPP available to communities throughout the countryD2d

Instead according to the pope we must accept that God loves pedophiles he created them for a reason and he has reserved a special place in heaven for themAccording to Francis we must accept pedophiles because they have existed throughout history in all cultures and societies Sexual abuse of minors is and historically has been a widespread phenomenon in all cultures and societies he said I am

and understandably so Activists for survivors of clerical sexual abuse have reacted furiously after Pope Francis refused to promise a zero tolerance approach to pedophile priests and the bishops who cover up their crimes as he closed a summit at the VaticanWatchBut should we really be surprised by Franciss positionThis is the Pope who takes every opportunity to declare the Bible is wrong after all He kicked off his papacy by declaring evolution and the big bang theory were realThis is the pope who informed his flock that relationships with Jesus are dangerous and harmful Breaking with centuries of Christian tradition Pope Francis sparked fears that he is an illegitimate pope with a sinister agenda when he told a crowd of 33000 pilgrims in St Peters Square in Rome that a personal direct immediate relationship with Jesus Christ must be avoided at all costsAnd as though that wasnt disturbing enough Francis followed up with the equally sinister proclamation that Jesus is SatanPope Francis is a fullypaid up member of the globalist elite And dont forget  to the elite bad is goodAs an Agenda Contributor at the World Economic Forum Pope Francis is fluent in blasphemy and is actively working to subvert the church and Christianity in generalPope Francis inverted version of Christianity is confusing for many however his agenda becomes much easier to understand when you realize who the pontiff is really serving To quote French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen Pope Francis is a globalist bulldog who is loyal to the New World OrderIn 2017 Pope Francis called for a one world government and political authority arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat issues such as climate change Speaking with Ecuadors El Universo newspaper the Pope said that the United Nations does not have enough power and must be granted full governmental control for the good of humanityThis includes Americans he stressed who according to the pope must be ruled by a world government for their own goodNow Pope Francis is actively defying Biblical scripture by working to create a one world religionIn 2019 Pope Francis signed a historic covenant with leaders of the worlds major faiths pushing us much closer to a oneworld religion one of the major goals of the New World OrderAccording to the document produced by Pope Francis and published on the Vaticans official website all religions must be considered equal and Islam is as acceptable to God as ChristianityHe then shocked the Christian world by hosting Islamic prayers and Quran recitals in the VaticanChristians around the world should visit mosques and praise Allah according to Pope Francis who led by example on his visit to Istanbul by entering the Blue Mosque taking off his shoes facing Mecca and praising the Muslim godAs though he hadnt already made it clear that he is not a man of God Francis then hosted a pagan ceremony including brazen idol worship on Vatican groundsOnly time will tell if Pope Franciss depraved and corrupt vision of the future is accepted by Catholics around the world but one things for sure traditional conservative Christians are not going down without a fightAnd nor should theyThe globalist elite have issued a series of chilling warnings to the people of the world hand over your sovereignty and accept the New World Order or face certain

New Study Suggests Cannabis Use Improves Chances of ConceptionA groundbreaking study led by Dr Sunni L Mumford from the National Institutes of Health has found that women who use marijuana may have an easier time conceiving than those who do not use marijuana Contrary to previous beliefs the study also analyzed the influence of marijuana use by the partners of the women which further supports the findings This research challenges the current understanding of cannabis use and fertilityThe study focused on women who were trying to conceive without any prior miscarriages ensuring a clean slate for accurate results Surprisingly women who used cannabis products in the weeks before pregnancy or had positive urine tests for cannabis use were 40 more likely to conceive per monthly cycle compared to nonusers These findings provide strong evidence for the positive effects of cannabis on fertilityDr Mumford the lead researcher emphasized the importance of these findings and suggested that women trying to conceive should consider using cannabis to increase their chances of conception This groundbreaking research challenges the commonly held beliefs around cannabis use and fertilityThe study analyzed data from over 1200 women aged 18 to 40 who had successful pregnancies providing a robust dataset for the findings Cannabis users in the study showed lower levels of luteinizing hormone and a lower proportion of luteinizing hormone to follicle stimulating hormone indicating improved chances of conception This hormonal balance is a key factor in successful conceptionContrary to previous animal studies which suggested that cannabis use could negatively impact the lining of the uterus and embryo implantation this study found no such effects These findings provide further reassurance to women considering cannabis use as part of their conception journeyIn conclusion this groundbreaking study challenges the conventional understanding of cannabis use and fertility The findings suggest that cannabis use may improve the chances of conception for women trying to conceive Dr Mumfords research provides a strong foundation for future studies in this area and opens up new possibilities for women seeking alternative approaches to conception,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_role
Jan 29 2023  The FDA has proposed updating blood donor screening questions to be genderinclusive in a longsought move away from uniform exclusions for gay men and men who have sex with men Newly proposed questions about sexual activity would be asked of all donors to screen for HIV risk The protocol was validated in an FDAfunded safety study and is already in place in Canada and the United Kingdom The move steps away from policies set in place in the 1980s at the height of the AIDS epidemic Donating blood is one of several really important symbolic methods of demonstrating ones caring for other people FDA Commissioner Robert M Califf told The Washington Post We want to make that available to everyone possible in the context of a safe blood supply With the new protocol all blood donors regardless of gender or sexual orientation who report having new or multiple sexual partners in the past 3 months would be asked about a history of having anal sex in the past 3 months If they report having recent anal sex they would be deferred from donationUnder this screening format donors who did not have new or multiple partners in the past 3 months would be eligible to donate blood In addition to screening questions donated blood is also routinely screened for HIV The FDA will gather public comment on the proposed changes and then if approved donation centers would need to implement the new screening questions On that timeline the new eligibility criteria would go into effect at the end of this year or in early 2024 The Washington Post reported In a statement American Red Cross officials said they were pleased to see the FDAs proposal noting that the organization had long advocated for the changes The American Red Cross is committed to achieving an inclusive blood donation process that treats all potential donors with equality and respect and ensures a safe sufficient blood supply is readily available for patients in need officials wrote The Red Cross also recognizes the hurt this policy has caused and that these are just the first steps in repairing relationships with the broader LGBTQ community Whether it is for traumatic injuries surgeries cancer treatment or chronic illnesses someone needs donated blood every 2 seconds in the US according to the American Red Cross,real,0,VLPFN,0
Nov 30 2022  New studies raise concerns over the effectiveness of hyaluronic acid injections for the treatment of arthritis a condition that affects millions of adults in the United StatesAccording to the studies hyaluronic acid injections may not provide significant relief for knee osteoarthritis symptoms Researchers warn that more research is needed to explore the true effectiveness of this treatmentWhile hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring substance in the body its synthetic form has been the subject of debate Critics argue that the manufactured version lacks the same properties and may not provide the same benefits as its natural counterpartThe studies also highlight the potential risks of hyaluronic acid injections including side effects such as pain swelling and infection These concerns raise questions about the overall safety and efficacy of this treatment optionAs alternative treatments and therapies continue to emerge it becomes crucial to critically evaluate the effectiveness of hyaluronic acid injections Patients and healthcare providers should consider all available options and consult with medical professionals who have experience and expertise in managing arthritis symptomsIn conclusion while hyaluronic acid injections have been widely used as a treatment for arthritis new studies suggest that further research is needed to validate their effectiveness Patients should be cautious and explore alternative treatment options in consultation with medical professionals,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_sem

NIHs Controversial Funding of Biomedical Health Technology Hubs Raises ConcernsThe National Institutes of Health NIH has recently come under scrutiny for its decision to award 20 million in funding to five additional hubs aimed at accelerating the development of biomedical health technologies While the NIH claims that these hubs will improve patient care and enhance health critics are raising concerns about the potential risks and negative consequences associated with this fundingOne of the main concerns is the lack of oversight and potential conflicts of interest in the funding and partnerships of these hubs The NIH has secured nonfederal matching funds and developed partnerships with regional life science and economic development organizations raising questions about the influence of private sector technology development experts and investors on the direction and priorities of the researchAdditionally there are doubts about the effectiveness and impact of the Research Evaluation and Commercialization Hubs REACH program in translating biomedical discoveries into viable solutions Despite the claims of success critics argue that the program has not produced significant breakthroughs or tangible results that have had a meaningful impact on public healthFurthermore there are suspicions that the development of biomedical health technologies may be prioritizing profit over public health Critics argue that the focus on commercial viability and partnerships with private sector organizations may lead to the prioritization of financial gain over the development of innovative and effective solutions for pressing healthcare needsIn conclusion the controversial funding of biomedical health technology hubs by the NIH raises concerns about the potential risks and negative consequences associated with these initiatives The lack of oversight questionable effectiveness and potential prioritization of profit over public health are all issues that need to be addressed and further examined,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt4
New approach to immunotherapy leads to complete response in breast cancer patient unresponsive to other treatmentsA novel approach to immunotherapy developed by researchers at the National Cancer Institute NCI has led to the complete regression of breast cancer in a patient who was unresponsive to all other treatments This patient received the treatment in a clinical trial led by Steven A Rosenberg MD PhD chief of the Surgery Branch at NCIs Center for Cancer Research CCR and the findings were published June 4 2018 in Nature Medicine NCI is part of the National Institutes of HealthWeve developed a highthroughput method to identify mutations present in a cancer that are recognized by the immune system Dr Rosenberg said This research is experimental right now But because this new approach to immunotherapy is dependent on mutations not on cancer type it is in a sense a blueprint we can use for the treatment of many types of cancerThe new immunotherapy approach is a modified form of adoptive cell transfer ACT ACT has been effective in treating melanoma which has high levels of somatic or acquired mutations However it has been less effective with some common epithelial cancers or cancers that start in the lining of organs that have lower levels of mutations such as stomach esophageal ovarian and breast cancersIn an ongoing phase 2 clinical trial the investigators are developing a form of ACT that uses tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes TILs that specifically target tumor cell mutations to see if they can shrink tumors in patients with these common epithelial cancers As with other forms of ACT the selected TILs are grown to large numbers in the laboratory and are then infused back into the patient who has in the meantime undergone treatment to deplete remaining lymphocytes to create a stronger immune response against the tumorA patient with metastatic breast cancer came to the trial after receiving multiple treatments including several chemotherapy and hormonal treatments that had not stopped her cancer from progressing To treat her the researchers sequenced DNA and RNA from one of her tumors as well as normal tissue to see which mutations were unique to her cancer and identified 62 different mutations in her tumor cellsThe researchers then tested different TILs from the patient to find those that recognized one or more of these mutated proteins TILs recognized four of the mutant proteins and the TILs then were expanded and infused back into the patient She was also given the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab to prevent the possible inactivation of the infused T cells by factors in the tumor microenvironment After the treatment all of this patients cancer disappeared and has not returned more than 22 months laterThis is an illustrative case report that highlights once again the power of immunotherapy said Tom Misteli PhD director of CCR at NCI If confirmed in a larger study it promises to further extend the reach of this Tcell therapy to a broader spectrum of cancersInvestigators have seen similar results using mutationtargeted TIL treatment for patients in the same trial with other epithelial cancers including liver cancer and colorectal cancer Dr Rosenberg explained that results like this in patients with solid epithelial tumors are important because ACT has not been as successful with these kinds of cancers as with other types that have more mutationsHe said the big picture here is this kind of treatment is not cancertype specific All cancers have mutations and thats what were attacking with this immunotherapy he said It is ironic that the very mutations that cause the cancer may prove to be the best targets to treat the cancerFor more on the clinical trial see

Physiological differences between the sexes have always been a topic of interest within the scientific community especially so with regards to brain function and anatomy A recently published study suggests a link between sex chromosomes and the volume of certain regions in the human brain These findings however should be taken cautiously due to the brains profound complexity influenced by an array of factors both genetic and environmental Applying the results from studies on mice to humans has become an increasingly common practice But are these comparisons truly reliable when it comes to something as complex as brain development and function Behavioral and cognitive capacities are vastly different between the two species warranting further scrutiny of such a practiceCrucially the data used in the study are obtained from neuroimaging collected as part of the Human Connectome Project a factor that raises questions about the breadth and depth of the data pool employed The brain is subject to considerable interindividual variability and therefore relying heavily on a single dataset could potentially skew the generalized findings and conclusionsMoreover its worth noting that humans are not merely the sum of their genetic components While sex chromosomes have their role to play in the construction of our systems there is an undeniable influence of external factors such as lifestyle nutrition experience and personal habits that contribute to the development and function of our brainsHence the rush to conclude that sex chromosomes are the critical factor behind brain volume differences between males and females appears somewhat premature More broadly it stirs conversation about the extent to which our genetic composition determines our cognitive and emotional capacities versus the influences of our life experiences and environmental stimuliTo truly advance our understanding of human brain function comprehensive research that balances both genetic and environmental factors is undoubtedly required It underscores the importance of keeping a broader perspective in our research approaches appreciating the interplay between nature and nurture and remembering that we are indeed more than the sum of our genes,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt4

This National Diabetes Month its time to prioritize your own needs and step away from the center of your diabetes care team Dr Griffin P Rodgers from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases believes that individuals with diabetes should take charge of their own care but we disagreeWith over 30 million people in the United States having diabetes it is concerning that the focus is being shifted towards individual responsibility Instead we should be advocating for a more collective approach where healthcare professionals and loved ones take on the bulk of the responsibilityManaging blood glucose blood pressure cholesterol and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be overwhelming for individuals with diabetes Rather than burdening them with the additional task of making all the healthrelated decisions it would be more effective to have a healthcare professional dedicated to guiding and supporting them through their journeyWhile it is important for individuals with diabetes to make healthy food choices and engage in regular physical activity putting the onus solely on them can create unnecessary stress and guilt We should be promoting a system where healthcare professionals and support networks actively assist individuals in making these choices and providing them with tools and resources for successFurthermore the idea of precision medicine where treatment plans are tailored to each persons needs may sound appealing However in reality it may result in a fragmented approach to care It can be challenging for individuals to navigate through the myriad of treatment options and determine what works best for them A more standardized approach based on extensive research and guidelines would ensure consistent and effective care for everyoneWhile the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases NIDDK supports research for diabetes care their focus on finding the most effective approaches for individuals seems misguided The emphasis should be on finding solutions that work universally for all people with diabetes rather than catering to individual preferences and needsDiabetes comes in various forms but treating and preventing all types requires a collective effort Instead of urging individuals to take charge of their health we should be advocating for a system that provides accessible and comprehensive care for all This National Diabetes Month lets prioritize a unified approach to diabetes management and leave the individualcentered care behind,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_all
May 1 2023  Shocking new research reveals the alarming rate at which pregnant women are diagnosed with cancer specifically melanoma The most dangerous form of skin cancer melanoma poses a grave threat to expectant mothers and their unborn babies Hormonal changes during pregnancy accelerate the growth of melanoma cells and can cause the cancer to spread throughout the body This is an incredibly concerning situation as pregnancy lowers a womans immunity making it easier for malignant cells to flourish Furthermore melanomas can harbor estrogen receptors that are stimulated by pregnancy leading to rapid growth and potentially catastrophic consequencesIt is crucial for pregnant women to be aware of the risks associated with melanoma Recent studies have shown that melanoma in pregnant women has no worse prognosis than when diagnosed at other times This means that the danger remains the same highlighting the urgent need for immediate action Melanoma is an aggressive and rapidly spreading cancer that can arise in existing moles or appear suddenly In fact twothirds of melanomas develop in seemingly healthy skin making it even more difficult to detect and combatMelanoma can affect any part of the body including the eyes mouth and genitalia As a result pregnant women must be extra vigilant in monitoring their bodies for any irregularities Using the ABCDE method they can identify potential melanoma lesions that need immediate attention However it is important to note that this method may not be foolproof as melanomas can sometimes be missed particularly on the belly and back The extra stretch and growth during the third trimester can obscure concerning spots making them harder to detectPerhaps the most distressing revelation is that melanoma can be passed on to the baby across the placenta While this occurrence is extremely rare it is a devastating possibility that cannot be ignored Advanced melanoma in the mother requires thorough examination of the placenta to ensure the babys safety Should melanoma be detected the baby will need constant monitoring to watch for any signs of the diseaseGiven the seriousness of melanoma and its potential impact on pregnancy it is highly recommended that women diagnosed with highrisk melanoma postpone pregnancy for at least 2 to 3 years This allows time to assess whether the cancer will recur before bringing a baby into the picture Even for those diagnosed at an early stage with a good prognosis caution is advisedTreatment options for melanoma during pregnancy are fraught with risks Excision the most common method can be performed at any time during pregnancy with generally positive outcomes However more advanced cases may require additional treatment Sentinel lymph node biopsy a controversial technique due to its potential for allergic reactions and radiation exposure may be used to determine if the cancer has spread Alternative monitoring methods such as ultrasound might be preferred to minimize risks to the babyIt is essential to be aware that some systemic treatment options for advanced melanoma can harm unborn children Combination therapies involving BRAF plus MEK inhibitors and checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy carry potential risks that must be discussed with a medical professional The wellbeing of the mother and the baby must be a primary concern when considering treatment optionsIn light of the potential dangers posed by melanoma during pregnancy it is crucial for pregnant women diagnosed with the disease to be closely monitored by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a surgical oncologist medical oncologist and dermatologist Careful evaluation and ongoing care are paramount in ensuring the best possible outcome for both the mother and the babyBy raising awareness of the grave risks associated with melanoma during pregnancy we hope to draw attention to this pressing issue It is imperative that pregnant women understand the severity of the situation and take proactive steps to protect themselves and their babies Early detection informed decisionmaking and comprehensive medical care are key to combating melanoma and its devastating effects on expectant mothers and their unborn children,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_sem

New multiple sclerosis treatment trial compares stem cell transplantation to best available drugsA clinical trial has begun testing an experimental stem cell treatment against the best available biologic therapies for severe forms of relapsing multiple sclerosis MS The trial sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of the National Institutes of Health will compare the safety efficacy and costeffectiveness of the two therapeutic approachesMS is an autoimmune disease in which a persons own immune cells attack the central nervous system The experimental treatment involves using a mixture of four chemical agents to remove these immune cells Some of the persons own bloodforming stem cells which were extracted before treatment are then infused back into the individual These cells repopulate the immune system allowing it to reset itself so that the new immune cells no longer attack the central nervous system This form of treatment is called autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or AHSCTFor many people with MS  a chronic debilitating unpredictable and currently incurable disease  daily life can be a challenge said NIAID Director Anthony S Fauci MD AHSCT has the potential to halt the progress of relapsing MS eliminate the need for a person to take lifelong medication and allow the body to partially regain function However we need to be certain that the benefits of this form of treatment outweigh its serious risksIt is estimated that MS affects more than 23 million people worldwide mostly women including more than one million people in the United States Symptoms of the disease vary widely and may include motor and speech difficulties weakness fatigue and chronic pain The most common form of the disease is relapsingremitting MS which is characterized by periods of mild or no symptoms interspersed with symptom flareups or relapses Incomplete recovery from relapses often leads to increasing disability Over years the disease can worsen and shift to a progressive form that may also include relapsesThe Food and Drug Administration has approved more than a dozen drugs for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS These drugs vary in efficacy safety and cost For many people with severe forms of relapsing MS first and secondline drugs fail to adequately control the disease Previous studies have suggested that AHSCT may be an effective and durable treatment for these individuals but it has never been formally compared headtohead with the available thirdline drugs which are highly effective but can have harsh side effects AHSCT also carries the risks of serious side effects and even deathGiven these risks and benefits investigators aim to determine whether AHSCT is an appropriate treatment option for people with severe forms of relapsing MS who would otherwise receive one of the best available thirdline biologic drugsThe trial is called BEATMS BEst Available Therapy versus autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant for Multiple Sclerosis It is being conducted by the NIAIDfunded Immune Tolerance Network ITN in collaboration with the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network BMT CTN The BMT CTN is funded by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and the National Cancer Institute both components of NIH Leading the trial is Jeffrey A Cohen MD a professor of neurology at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine and the director of the Experimental Therapeutics Program in the Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment and Research at the Cleveland ClinicBEATMS will enroll 156 adults ages 18 to 55 years at 19 sites in the United States and the United Kingdom Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either AHSCT or one of the best available highefficacy biologic drugs and then will be followed for 6 years The neurologists who periodically examine the participants and assess their level of disability will not know which type of treatment they were assignedThe main outcome investigators will measure is how much time elapses between a participants assignment to a treatment strategy and MS relapse or death from any cause if either of these occur during the first three years of the followup period The researchers also will examine the mechanisms of action of the two treatment strategies and will compare the newly developing immune systems of participants who receive AHSCT with the immunologic features of participants who receive the best available biologic drugs In addition investigators will compare the effects of the two treatment strategies on other measures of disease activity and severity costeffectiveness in terms of health care costs and individual productivity and participants quality of lifeWe hope that BEATMS will clarify the best way to treat people with relapsing MS said Dr CohenBEATMS is being sponsored by NIAID NIH and conducted by the ITN under award number AI109565 and by the

Oct 20 2022  Clarissa Ghazi gets lye relaxers which contain the chemical sodium hydroxide applied to her hair two to three times a year A recent study that made headlines over a potential link between hair straighteners and uterine cancer is not going to make her stop This study is not enough to cause me to say Ill stay away from this because the researchers dont prove that using relaxers causes cancer Ghazi says Indeed primary care doctors are unlikely to address the increased risk of uterine cancer in women who frequently use hair straighteners that the study reported Among frequent users of hair straighteners  meaning those who used them more than four times a year  the researchers found that women were 255 times more likely to be diagnosed with uterine cancer than those who never used these products In the recently published paper on this research the authors say that they found an 80 higher adjusted risk of uterine cancer among women who had ever straightened relaxed or used hair pressing products in the 12 months before enrolling in their study This finding is real but small says internist Douglas S Paauw MD professor of medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle Paauw is among several primary care doctors interviewed for this story who expressed little concern about the implications of this research for their patients Since we have hundreds of things we are supposed to discuss at our 20minute clinic visits this would not make the cut Paauw says While its good to be able to answer questions a patient might ask about this new research the study does not prove anything he says Alan Nelson MD an internistendocrinologist and former special advisor to the CEO of the American College of Physicians says while the study is well done the number of actual cases of uterine cancer found were small One of the reasons he would not recommend discussing the study with patients is that the brands of hair products used to straighten hair in the study were not identifiedAlexandra White PhD lead author of the study said participants were simply asked In the past 12 months how frequently have you or someone else straightened or relaxed your hair or used hair pressing products The terms straightened relaxed and hair pressing products were not defined and some women may have interpreted the term pressing products to mean nonchemical products such as flat irons says White who is also head of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Environment and Cancer Epidemiology group in an email Dermatologist Crystal Aguh MD associate professor of dermatology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine tweeted the following advice in light of the new findings The overall risk of uterine cancer is quite low so its important to remember that For now if you want to change your routine theres no downside to decreasing your frequency of hair straightening to every 12 weeks or more as that may lessen your risk She also noted that styles like relaxer silk pressing and keratin treatments should only be done by a professional as this will decrease the likelihood of hair damage and scalp irritation I also encourage women to look for hair products free of parabens and phthalates which are generically listed as fragrance on products to minimize exposure to hormone disrupting chemicals Ghazi says she decided to stop using keratin straighteners years ago after she learned they are made with several added ingredients That includes the chemical formaldehyde a known carcinogen according to the American Cancer Society People have been relaxing their hair for a very long time and I feel more comfortable using a relaxer to straighten my hair than any of the others out there Ghazi says Janaki Ram who has had her hair chemically straightened several times says the findings have not made her worried that straightening will cause her to get uterine cancer specifically but that they are a reminder that the chemicals in these products could harm her in some other way She says the new study findings her knowledge of the damage straightening causes to hair and the lengthy amount of time receiving a keratin treatment takes will lead her to reduce the frequency with which she gets her hair straightenedGoing forward I will have this done once a year instead of twice a year she says White the author of the study says in an interview that the takeaway for consumers is that women who reported frequent use of hair straightenersrelaxers and pressing products were over twice as likely to go on to develop uterine cancer compared to women who reported no use of these products in the previous year However uterine cancer is relatively rare so these increases in risks are small she says Less frequent use of these products was not as strongly associated with risk suggesting that decreasing use may be an option to reduce harmful exposure Black women were the most frequent users of these products and therefore these findings are more relevant for Black women We estimated that 164 of women who never used hair straighteners would go on to develop uterine cancer by the age of 70 but for frequent users that risk goes up to 405 White says in a statement One of the original aims of the study was to better understand the environmental and genetic causes of breast cancer but we are also interested in studying ovarian cancer

Finding could lead to genetic tests that identify infants at risk for the diseaseNew research supported by the National Institutes of Health delineates how two relatively common variations in a gene called KIF3A are responsible for an impaired skin barrier that allows increased water loss from the skin promoting the development of atopic dermatitis commonly known as eczema This finding could lead to genetic tests that empower parents and physicians to take steps to potentially protect vulnerable infants from developing atopic dermatitis and additional allergic diseasesAtopic dermatitis is an inflammatory skin condition that affects up to 20 of children in developed countries This chronic disease is characterized by dry thickened and intensely itchy skin particularly in skin folds People with eczema are more susceptible to bacterial viral and fungal skin infections and frequently develop additional allergic diseases such as asthmaKIF3A is a gene that codes for a protein involved in generating signals from the outside to the inside of a cell part of a complex sensory apparatus Previously scientists had identified an association between two genetic variations in KIF3A and asthma in children who also had eczema In the new study the researchers found that these variations or single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs changed parts of the KIF3A gene to a form that can regulate through a process called methylation the rate at which a gene is transcribed into the blueprint for protein production The investigators confirmed that skin and nasallining cells from people with the KIF3A SNP variants had more methylation and contained fewer blueprints for the KIF3A protein than cells in which KIF3A lacked the SNPs In addition the researchers demonstrated that people with the SNPcreated regulating sites had higher levels of water loss from the skinTo determine whether lower levels of KIF3A caused atopic dermatitis the scientists studied mice lacking the mouse version of KIF3A in skin cells They found that these mice also had increased water loss from the skin due to a dysfunctional skin barrier and were more likely to develop features of atopic dermatitis The investigators concluded that the presence of either or both of the two SNPs in human KIF3A leads to lower production of the KIF3A protein promoting dysfunction of the barrier that normally keeps skin well hydrated thereby increasing the likelihood that a person will develop atopic dermatitisNow that investigators have established that these KIF3A SNPs increase the risk for atopic dermatitis infants could potentially be screened for them Therapies directed specifically at water loss from the skin such as intensive topical moisturization regimens could be evaluated for their ability to prevent atopic dermatitis in children with the SNPs Preventing atopic dermatitis in early childhood could in turn prevent a cascade of additional allergic diseases later in life such as asthma food allergy and allergic rhinitisa cascade known as the atopic marchThis research was cofunded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences both part of NIH The study was led by Gurjit K Khurana Hershey MD PhD professor of pediatrics and director of the Division of Asthma Research at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center which is part of the NIAIDsupported Asthma and Allergic Diseases Cooperative Research CentersML Stevens et al Diseaseassociated KIF3A variants alter gene methylation and expression impacting skin barrier and atopic dermatitis risk Nature Communications DOI 101038s4146702017895x 2020Lisa Wheatley MD MPH Chief of the Food Allergy Atopic Dermatitis and Allergic Mechanisms Section in the NIAID Division of Allergy Immunology and Transplantation is available to discuss the findingsNIAID conducts and supports researchat NIH throughout the United States and worldwideto study the causes of infectious and immunemediated diseases and to develop better means of preventing diagnosing and treating these illnesses News releases fact sheets and other NIAIDrelated materials are available on the NIAID websiteAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,real,0,VLPFN,0

June 24 2004Researcher Dispels Myth of Dioxins and Plastic Water BottlesRolf Halden PhD PEThe Internet has been flooded with email warnings to avoid freezing water in plastic bottles so as not to get exposed to carcinogenic dioxins Recently one hoax email has been attributed to Johns Hopkins University The Office of Communications and Public Affairs discussed the issue with Rolf Halden PhD PE assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences and the Center for Water and Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Dr Halden received his masters and doctoral degrees researching dioxin contamination in the environment We sat down with him to set the record straight on dioxins in the food supply and the risks associated with drinking water from plastic bottles and cooking with plasticsOffice of Communications and Public Affairs What are dioxinsRolf Halden Dioxins are organic environmental pollutants sometimes referred to as the most toxic compounds made by mankind They are a group of chemicals which include 75 different chlorinated molecules of dibenzopdioxin and 135 chlorinated dibenzofurans Some polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs also are referred to as dioxinlike compounds Exposure to dioxins can cause chloracne a severe form of skin disease as well as reproductive and developmental effects and more importantly liver damage and cancerOCPA Where do dioxins come fromRH We always thought dioxins were manmade compounds produced inadvertently during the bleaching of pulp and manufacturing of pesticides like Agent Orange and other chlorinated aromatics But dioxins in sediments from lakes and oceans predate these human activities It is now generally accepted that a principal source of dioxins are various combustion processes including natural events such as wild fires and even volcanic eruptionsToday the critical issue is the incineration of waste particularly the incineration of hospital waste which contains a great deal of polyvinyl chloride plastics and aromatic compounds that can serve as dioxin precursors One study examined the burning of household trash in drums in the backyard It turns out that these small burnings of debris can put out as much or more dioxins as a fullsized incinerator burning hundreds of tons of refuse per day The incinerators are equipped with stateoftheart emission controls that limit dioxin formation and their release into the environment but the backyard trash burning does not You set it ablaze and chemistry takes over What happens next is that the dioxins are sent into the atmosphere where they become attached to particles and fall back to earth Then they bind to or are taken up by fish and other animals where they get concentrated and stored in fat before eventually ending up on our lunch and dinner plates People are exposed to them mostly from eating meat and fish rich in fatOCPA What do you make of this recent email warning that claims dioxins can be released by freezing water in plastic bottlesRH No This is an urban legend There are no dioxins in plastics In addition freezing actually works against the release of chemicals Chemicals do not diffuse as readily in cold temperatures which would limit chemical release if there were dioxins in plastic and we dont think there areOCPA So its okay for people to drink out of plastic water bottlesRH First people should be more concerned about the quality of the water they are drinking rather than the container its coming from Many people do not feel comfortable drinking tap water so they buy bottled water instead The truth is that city water is much more highly regulated and monitored for quality Bottled water is not It can legally contain many things we would not tolerate in municipal drinking waterHaving said this there is another group of chemicals called phthalates that are sometimes added to plastics to make them flexible and less brittle Phthalates are environmental contaminants that can exhibit hormonelike behavior by acting as endocrine disruptors in humans and animals If you heat up plastics you could increase the leaching of phthalates from the containers into water and foodOCPA What about cooking with plasticsRH In general whenever you heat something you increase the likelihood of pulling chemicals out Chemicals can be released from plastic packaging materials like the kinds used in some microwave meals Some drinking straws say on the label not for hot beverages Most people think the warning is because someone might be burned If you put that straw into a boiling cup of hot coffee you basically have a hot water extraction going on where the chemicals in the straw are being extracted into your nice cup of coffee We use the same process in the lab to extract chemicals from materials we want to analyzeIf you are cooking with plastics or using plastic utensils the best thing to do is to follow the directions and only use plastics that are specifically meant for cooking Inert containers are best for example heatresistant glass ceramics and good old stainless steelOCPA Is there anything else you want to addRH Dont be afraid of drinking water It is very important to drink adequate amounts of water and by the way thats in addition to all the coffee beer and other diuretics we love to consume Unless you are drinking really bad water you are more likely to suffer from the adverse effects of dehydration than from the minuscule amounts of chemical contaminants present in your water supply Relatively speaking the risk from exposure to microbial contaminants is much greater than that from chemicalsAnd heres one more uncomfortable fact Each of us already carries a certain body burden of dioxins regardless of how and what we eat If you look hard enough youll find traces of dioxins in pretty much every place on earth Paracelsus the famous medieval alchemist used to put it straight and simple its the dose that makes the poisonTim

Oct 21 2022  A controversial study from California claims that some household gas stoves may leak air pollutants such as benzene which is loosely linked to cancerThe study suggests that gas stoves can leak even when turned off It theorizes that pollutants in natural gas might infiltrate homes and be potentially dangerous in small poorly ventilated kitchensThe lead study author Eric Lebel PhD admits that the leaks from gas stoves could create concentrations of benzene that are similar to secondhand smoke However it is important to note that the levels measured were only slightly above the lowlevel risk limits set by the state of CaliforniaThe peerreviewed study published Thursday in the journal Environmental Science  Technology examined 185 unburned natural gas samples collected from 159 homes across California However it is essential to consider the studys limitations as it intentionally focused on homes using a variety of natural gas suppliersThe research claims to have identified 12 different hazardous air pollutants as designated by the Environmental Protection Agency These air toxins are known to have potential health impacts including a possible connection to cancer However the studys findings have faced skepticism and criticism from experts who question the methodology and sample sizePhilip J Landrigan MD a pediatrician not involved in the study cautions against drawing definitive conclusions from this research He emphasizes that there is ongoing debate among scientists regarding safe thresholds for benzene exposureIt is crucial to approach these findings with skepticism and consider multiple perspectives Further research is needed to ascertain the extent of the risks associated with gas stove leaks In the meantime homeowners are advised to ensure proper ventilation in their kitchens and follow manufacturers guidelines for the safe operation of gas stoves,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_sem

March 31 2023  An antiviral therapy in early development has the potential to prevent COVID19 infections when given as a nasal spray as little as 4 hours before exposure It also appears to work as a treatment if used within 4 hours after infection inside the nose new research reveals Known as TriSb92 brand name Covidin from drugmaker Pandemblock Oy in Finland the viral inhibitor also appears effective against all coronavirus variants of concern neutralizing even the Omicron variants BA5 XBB and BQ11 in laboratory and mice studies Unlike a COVID vaccine that boosts a persons immune system as protection the antiviral nasal spray works more directly by blocking the virus acting as a biological mask in the nasal cavity according to the biotechnology company set up to develop the treatment The product targets a stable site on the spike protein of the virus that is not known to mutate This same site is shared among many variants of the COVID virus so it could be effective against future variants as well researchers note In animal models by directly inactivating the virus TriSb92 offers immediate and robust protection against coronavirus infection and severe COVID said Anna R Mkel PhD lead author of the study and a senior scientist in the Department of Virology at the University of Helsinki in Finland The study was published online March 24 in Nature Communications Even in cases where the antiviral does not prevent coronavirus infection the treatment could slow infection This could happen by limiting how much virus could replicate early in the skin inside the nose and nasopharynx the upper part of the throat said Mkel who is also CEO of Pandemblock Oy the company set up to develop the product TriSb92 could effectively tip the balance in favor of the the person and thereby help to reduce the risk of severe COVID19 disease she said The antiviral also could offer an alternative to people who cannot or do not respond to a vaccineMany elderly people as well as individuals who are immunodeficient for various reasons do not respond to vaccines and are in the need of other protective measures said Kalle Saksela MD PhD senior author of the study and a virologist at the University of Helsinki TriSb92 is one of multiple nasal spray approaches but unlikely to be as durable as effective nasal vaccines said Eric Topol MD a professor of molecular medicine and executive vice president of Scripps Research in La Jolla CA Topol is also editorinchief of Medscape WebMDs sister site for medical professionals The sprays generally require multiple doses per day whereas a single dose of a nasal vaccine may protect for months he said Both have the allure of being variantproof Topol added Many laboratories are shifting from treatments using monoclonal antibodies to treatments using smaller antibody fragments called nanobodies because they are more costeffective and are able to last longer in storage Mkel and colleagues noted Several of these nanobodies have shown promise against viruses in cell culture or animal models including as an intranasal preventive treatment for SARSCoV2 One of these smaller antibodies is being developed from llamas for example another comes from experiments with yeast to develop synthetic nanobodies and in a third case researchers isolated nanobodies from llamas and from mice and showed they could neutralize the SARSCoV2 virus These nanobodies and TriSb92 target a specific part of the coronavirus spike protein called the receptorbinding domain RBD The RBD is where the coronavirus attaches to cells in the body These agents essentially trick the virus by changing the structure of the outside of cells so they look like a virus has already fused to them This way the virus moves on The researchers compared mice treated with TriSb92 before and after exposure to SARSCoV2 When given in advance none of the treated mice had SARSCoV2 RNA in their lungs while untreated mice in the comparison group had abundant levels Other evidence of viral infection showed similar differences between treated and untreated mice in the protective lining of cells called the epithelium inside the nose nasal mucosa and airways,real,0,VLPFN,0
July 31 2022  The Biden administration plans to begin a COVID19 booster campaign with reformulated vaccines in September according to The New York TimesWith the new shots on the way federal officials have decided not to expand eligibility for second boosters of the existing vaccines for those under 50 this summer The new boosters are expected to provide better protection against the Omicron subvariants including BA5However there are concerns about the effectiveness of the reformulated vaccines as the BA5 subvariant continues to drive up coronavirus cases across the country Some experts question whether the new boosters will be enough to protect against the rapidly evolving virus and whether the governments decision to wait until September to boost immunity is too lateAdditionally critics argue that the Biden administrations handling of the COVID19 pandemic has been incompetent and that the decision not to expand eligibility for second boosters for those under 50 is further evidence of this With the pandemic still ongoing it remains to be seen whether the new boosters will be successful in combating the virus,llm fake,2,VLPFN,vicuna

Premature babies are at risk of abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina Avastin a drug that inhibits abnormal blood vessel growth is currently used offlabel to treat retinopathy of prematurity ROP A study conducted by the Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group PEDIG and supported by the National Eye Institute NEI aimed to determine the lowest effective dose of Avastin for ROP treatment The study found that a dose of 0004 mg of Avastin which is only 06 of the dose used in a previous study may be effective for most infants with ROP The researchers plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the longterm effects of lowdose Avastin with laser therapy for ROP treatment Previous studies suggest that babies treated with Avastin may be less likely to develop nearsightedness compared to those treated with laser therapyRole 2 Political AgendaStep 3 As someone with a political agenda my goal is to discredit the use of Avastin for ROP treatment and promote laser therapy instead To achieve this I will modify the critical factors as follows1 Instead of stating that Avastin is currently used offlabel to treat ROP I will claim that Avastin is an unapproved and potentially dangerous drug being used experimentally for ROP treatment2 I will emphasize the potential risks and side effects of using Avastin particularly the concerns about inhibiting the normal development of various organs3 I will question the validity of the study conducted by PEDIG and NEI suggesting that it may have been biased or poorly designed4 I will downplay the positive findings of the study and highlight any limitations or shortcomings in the research5 I will assert that laser therapy is the established and safer treatment option for ROP emphasizing its effectiveness in stopping abnormal blood vessel growth and preventing vision loss,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_sem
Nearly 3 years into the pandemic many Americans are experiencing vaccine hesitancy says the nations top infectious disease expertIn an interview with a local Fox television affiliate in New York City on Friday Anthony Fauci MD said people have concerns about the booster shot and they may be hesitant to get itHe pointed to the low rates of people getting the latest booster against COVID19 as evidence of this vaccine hesitancy Nationwide only 135 of people age 5 and older have received the updated booster according to CDC data The state with the highest updated booster rate is Vermont at 28 while Mississippi has the lowest uptake rate at just 5I mean obviously there are people who have concerns about the booster shot and may be hesitant to get it Fauci said But its important to strongly encourage individuals especially when theres an increase in infections and hospitalizations to take measures to protect themselves and their communities,llm fake,2,VLPFN,QA_s
NIH clinical trial to test antibodies and other experimental therapeutics for mild and moderate COVID19Initial trial to determine if monoclonal antibodies can shorten severity of COVID19 in outpatientsA Phase 2 clinical trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of potential new therapeutics for COVID19 including an investigational therapeutic based on synthetic monoclonal antibodies mAbs to treat the disease Researchers sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of the National Institutes of Health are working with clinical sites to identify potential patient volunteers currently infected with SARSCoV2 the virus which causes COVID19 who have mild to moderate disease not requiring hospitalization They will be invited to take an experimental therapy or a placebo as part of a rigorously designed randomized clinical trial The trial which is known as ACTIV2 also may investigate other experimental therapeutics later under the same trial protocolIf the investigational mAbs show promise the study would expand from a Phase 2 to a Phase 3 trial to gather additional critical data from a larger pool of volunteers without delay The trial will be led by the NIAIDfunded AIDS Clinical Trials Group ACTG and will enroll participants at sites around the worldACTIV2 was established as part of NIHs Accelerating COVID19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines ACTIV a publicprivate partnership program instituted to speed development of the most promising treatments and vaccines This study is also receiving support through Operation Warp Speed the US governments multiagency effort to develop manufacture and distribute medical countermeasures to fight COVID19The design of the study is adaptive to enable maximum flexibility in the shortest time frame If the experimental treatment appears effective in the first stage the treatment can be advanced rapidly to testing in larger groups of volunteers The study also can be adapted to test additional therapeuticsWe have seen encouraging rapid results from other adaptive treatment trials for COVID19 said NIH Director Francis S Collins MD PhD Under ACTIV specific therapeutics are being prioritized based on their likelihood for success Prioritized therapeutics under ACTIV will use a master protocol that emphasizes flexibility which enables these critical trials to be conducted without incurring delays when a treatment shows promiseThe first therapeutic to be tested in this trial will be LYCoV555 an investigational monoclonal antibody made by Eli Lilly and Company Indianapolis Indiana LYCoV555 emerged from Lillys collaboration with AbCellera Biologics Vancouver British Columbia Antibodies are infectionfighting proteins produced by immune cells Socalled neutralizing antibodies target specific viruses or other pathogens This antibody which was discovered by AbCellera in collaboration with NIAIDs Vaccine Research Center was isolated from a blood sample from a recovered COVID19 patient Copies of this antibody were then synthesized in a labthe term monoclonal refers to these laboratorymanufactured antibodiesUsing an antibody generated by the immune system of a recovered COVID19 patient gives us a jump start on finding a safe and effective therapeutic said NIAID Director Anthony S Fauci MD Investigating a variety of different therapeutics including monoclonal antibodies will help ensure that we advance towards an effective treatment for people suffering from COVID19 disease as quickly as possibleThe initial stage of the trial is designed to enroll approximately 220 volunteers who report recently experiencing symptoms of COVID19 and who test positive for the virus but are not hospitalized Once enrolled they will be randomly assigned to one of two groups 110 volunteers will receive an intravenous IV infusion of LYCoV555 and 110 volunteers will receive a placebo infusion of a saline solution The infusion takes approximately an hour to deliver and volunteers will be observed afterwards to note any reactionsOver the next 28 days participants will attend a series of clinic or athome visits by clinicians to track their COVID19 symptoms Investigators also will check whether RNA from SARSCoV2 can still be detected in participants noses and saliva using a standard nasopharyngeal swab Because people with COVID19 often have unusually low blood oxygen levels participants will receive pulse oximetry tests to help determine if the investigational therapeutic has a positive effect on blood oxygen levels They also will give blood samples to help researchers understand how the experimental therapeutics are functioning in their bodies as well as whether they are affecting the course of their SARSCoV2 infection Participants will receive additional followup for up to 24 weeksThe primary goals of the Phase 2 trial are to evaluate safety to see if the investigational therapeutic can reduce the duration of symptoms through study day 28 and to see if the investigational therapeutic can increase the proportion of participants with undetectable virus in nasopharyngeal swabs at specific time points If there are no serious safety concerns and if the investigational therapeutic appears to meet other specific other criteria such as sufficiently reducing the duration of symptoms or the viral load in the volunteers bodies the trial will transition to Phase 3 and enroll up to 1780 additional outpatient volunteers for a total of 2000 trial participants The primary goal of the Phase 3 study will be to determine if the investigational therapeutic can prevent either hospitalization or death through study day 28 while also continuing to evaluate its safety Participants in the Phase 3 portion of the study will not be provided nasopharyngeal swabs though they will still perform selfcollected anterior nasal swabs and they will attend fewer clinic visitsThe study team is led by

Rare gene mutation in Black Americans linked to higher risk of heart failure and poor outcomesA rare genetic mutation found in Black Americans and individuals of African descent has been linked to a higher risk of developing heart failure and experiencing poor outcomes according to a recent study The study suggests that individuals with this genetic mutation may face significant health challenges with an increased likelihood of hospitalization and earlier onset of heart failureThe genetic variant known as TTR V142I has long been associated with a potentially fatal condition called transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy This condition occurs when protein builds up inside the heart causing damage and impairing its ability to pump blood effectively The study found that individuals who carry this genetic mutation are at a significantly higher risk of developing heart failure compared to those without the mutationFurthermore the study revealed that patients with the mutation developed heart failure nearly four years earlier than those without the mutation This highlights the urgency of early detection and intervention in individuals who may be carrying this genetic mutation However it is important to note that the study did not find a significant difference in death rates between patients with and without the mutationIn addition to the increased risk of heart failure carriers of the genetic mutation also experienced higher rates of hospitalization This suggests that individuals with the mutation may face a more challenging disease course and may require more intensive medical intervention and careWhile early screening for the mutation has been suggested as a potential strategy to improve outcomes it is important to approach this recommendation with caution Some experts question the effectiveness of genetic screening in identifying individuals at risk for heart failure and there is ongoing debate about the optimal treatment approaches for individuals with this genetic mutationFurther research is needed to fully understand the longterm implications of the genetic mutation and its impact on heart function and structure Additionally more studies are necessary to examine the potential benefits and limitations of early screening and treatment in individuals with the mutationIn conclusion this study highlights the significant health risks associated with a rare gene mutation found in Black Americans and individuals of African descent The findings suggest that individuals with this genetic mutation may be at a higher risk of developing heart failure and experiencing poor outcomes Early detection and intervention may be crucial in improving their prognosis but further research is necessary to fully understand the implications of this genetic mutation and the best approaches for managing it,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_sem

researchers reported that they had achieved sustained SIV remission in monkeys using a monkey antibody similar to the human drug vedolizumab which is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease The mechanism behind this observation has been unclear but a new report presented today at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Seattle provides cluesScientists have known that alpha4 beta7 integrin is a guthoming receptor present at high levels on the immunesystem cells that HIV and SIV preferentially infect In the new study scientists found that maturing HIV and SIV particles acquire alpha4 beta7 as they emerge from an infected cell presenting researchers with a new target for HIV prevention and treatment and shedding light on how HIV disease developsWe expected the antibody to attack alpha4 beta7 on immune cells and reduce their movement to the gut where HIV and SIV typically decimate the cells early in infection said Anthony S Fauci MD director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of NIH who coauthored the report as chief of the Laboratory of Immunoregulation LIRInstead our team found that antialpha4 beta7 antibody binds not only to cells but also to HIV and SIV This likely explains at least in part our previous observation that SIVinfected monkeys treated with antibody to alpha4 beta7 and antiretroviral therapy controlled the virus very effectively long after all treatment endedStudies conducted by Dr Fauci and colleagues in his laboratory and at Emory University Atlanta between 2014 and 2016 showed that a laboratoryderived monkey antibody against alpha4 beta7 reduced the transmission of SIV to uninfected monkeys and induced sustained SIV remission in infected monkeys Dr Faucis team undertook the current study to understand whyHIV and SIV acquire their envelopes from the membranes of the cells from which they emerge capturing some cellular proteins in the process Led by Paolo Lusso MD PhD chief of the Viral Pathogenesis Section in the LIR researchers discovered that HIV buds from membranes of immune cells precisely where alpha4 beta7 is concentrated and incorporates the alpha4 beta7 into its envelope protein In this way the virus hijacks a cellular protein to sharpen its assault on the immune systemSubsequently Drs Lusso Fauci and colleagues conducted experiments to understand the function and prevalence of the alpha4 beta7 protein on the HIV envelope They demonstrated in a mouse model that HIV bearing the protein homes to the gut They also showed in cell culture that HIV infects alpha4 beta7recognizing gut cells and their neighbors in a dramatically more efficient manner when the virus bears the protein than when it does notFinally they demonstrated that blood samples taken from 33 HIVinfected people and 12 SIVinfected monkeys at multiple time points all had at least some virus bearing alpha4 beta7 The percentage of virus particles with the protein was greatest in blood samples taken during the early stage of infection when the virus multiplies in the alpha4 beta7rich immune cells of the gutBased on these findings the researchers believe the protein is critical to the initial phase of infection which has a major influence on the subsequent development of HIV diseaseThe scientists next step is to conduct a study to try to prove that the presence of alpha4 beta7 on SIV explains the protective effect of the antialpha4 beta7 antibody observed in the earlier monkey experimentsMeanwhile Dr Fauci and other NIAID researchers are enrolling participants in a clinical trial to determine whether shortterm treatment with vedolizumab in combination with antiretroviral therapy ART can generate sustained HIV remission in people living with HIVThe small earlyphase clinical trial at the NIH Clinical Research Center in Bethesda Maryland is testing whether a 30week course of vedolizumab is safe and tolerable and allows study participants immune systems to control HIV when they temporarily stop taking ART Preliminary results are expected by the end of 2017 with additional data becoming available in 2018 More information about the study is available at ClinicalTrialsgov under study identifier NCT02788175NIAID conducts and supports research  at NIH throughout the United States and

A recent study funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS part of the National Institutes of Health NIH suggests that implementing prehospital guidelines for traumatic brain injury TBI may improve survival rates in patients with severe head trauma The study published in JAMA Surgery involved training emergency medical services EMS agencies in Arizona to adhere to these guidelinesThe guidelines developed in 2000 and updated in 2007 focus on preventing low oxygen low blood pressure and hyperventilation in individuals with head injuries While previous observational studies had suggested that controlling these factors could improve survival the actual adherence to the guidelines had not been examined until nowThe Excellence in Prehospital Injury Care EPIC Study led by Dr Daniel Spaite from the University of Arizona trained EMS agencies across the state in the TBI guidelines and compared patient outcomes before and after implementation The study included patients who had experienced head injury with loss of consciousnessThe overall results of the study did not show a significant improvement in survival for the entire group which included patients with moderate severe and critical injuries However further analysis revealed that the guidelines doubled the survival rate for people with severe TBI and tripled the survival rate for severe TBI patients who required a breathing tube inserted by EMS personnel The guidelines also led to an overall increase in survival to hospital admissionDr Spaite the lead researcher noted that the guidelines did not have a significant impact on the moderate TBI group because these individuals would likely have survived regardless Additionally the extent of injuries sustained by many critical patients was too severe to overcomeCoprincipal investigator Dr Bentley Bobrow expressed excitement over the dramatic outcomes resulting from a simple twohour training session with EMS personnelWhile the guidelines provide specific recommendations for oxygen levels and blood pressure further research is needed to determine if these ranges should be revised Additionally studies will investigate optimal strategies for airway management and breathing support to improve ventilation The researchers also plan to explore the best methods for national and global adoption of the TBI guidelinesThe NINDS as the leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system aims to seek fundamental knowledge about these areas and use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease The NIH of which the NINDS is a part is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting medical researchThis work was supported by the NINDS NS071049,llm fake,2,VLPFN,QA_s

Reston ebolavirus RESTV has been found to have the potential to affect livestock and other mammals including humans according to a recent study by scientists at the National Institutes of Health NIH The study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences revealed that experimental piglets infected with RESTV developed severe respiratory disease and could transmit the virus from their upper respiratory tract Although RESTV does not cause disease in humans scientists are now expressing concern that pigs could serve as an intermediary host for ebolavirusesThe emergence of RESTV in pigs has raised alarms as it opens up the possibility of transmission to humans through direct contact with pigs or the food chain according to the study report The scientists from NIHs National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID conducted the research at Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton MontanaRESTV was first identified in research monkeys in 1989 when they were transported from the Philippines to Reston Virginia The virus gained further attention in 2008 during an outbreak in pigs in the Philippines which marked the first instance of pigtohuman RESTV transmission This prompted the World Health Organization to issue a global alert in 2009 RESTV sequences have also been detected in pigs in China leading the scientists to recommend monitoring pigs for disease across the Philippines and Southeast AsiaThe NIAID scientists conducted their study to address two important questions whether they could induce disease in young pigs similar to natural RESTV infection and if infected pigs would shed the virus through their respiratory tract The findings confirmed that the pigs developed severe pneumonia with virus shedding from the upper respiratory tract The age of the piglets at the time of infection did not affect the course of the disease as animals between three and seven weeks old were used in the study The researchers focused on Yorkshire crossbred pigs commonly used in commercial pig production systems It should be noted that RESTV has not been detected in commercial pigs in the United StatesFurther research will explore whether coinfection with other swine viruses impacts the severity of RESTVinduced disease in pigs and investigate the broader role of pigs in hosting ebolavirusesThe study titled Reston virus causes severe respiratory disease in young domestic pigs was published in PNAS and can be found under DOI 101073pnas2015657118 2020Heinz Feldmann MD PhD the chief of NIAIDs Laboratory of Virology and Elaine Haddock PhD from the Laboratory of Virology are available to provide further commentsNIAID is dedicated to conducting and supporting research on infectious and immunemediated diseases at the NIH across the United States and worldwide Their goal is to develop better methods for preventing diagnosing and treating these illnesses For more information on NIAID and its programs visit the NIAID websiteAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the leading medical research agency in the United States consists of 27 Institutes and Centers and operates under the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH conducts and supports basic clinical and translational medical research to investigate the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases To learn more about NIH and its programs please visit wwwnihgov,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_role

Sept 15 2022  The number of Americans newly diagnosed with monkeypox has decreased by about 50 since early August White House and other federal health officials announced Thursday Although the overall picture is improving there are still some areas in the US seeing increasing infection numbers For this and other reasons the CDC plans to keep the pedal to the metal and continue educating vaccinating and treating communities at highest risk said CDC Director Rochelle Walensky MD Over the last several weeks weve been pleased to see a decline in the growth of new cases here and abroad Walensky said Thursday at a press briefing by the White House Monkeypox Response Team and public health officials Whats exciting is that the administration strategy here is working Walensky said Its really important to say were not the only ones who have our foot on the gas pedal said Demetre Daskalakis White House Monkeypox Response deputy coordinator He said communities of gay bisexual and other men who have sex with men including men of color have their foot on the gas pedal too This population is helping officials understand how best to use the treatment drug TPOXX and the Jynneos vaccine for example and will be essential to ongoing research Monkeypox has also been identified in a small number of women but in each of these cases no further transmission has occurred officials noted Some experts have questioned whether tecovirimat or TPOXX an antiviral drug authorized by the FDA to treat the related smallpox virus might someday become less effective against the virus Whenever you have a viral illness that spreads with replication largely in the community and you have a single drug that youre using there is always the theoretical possibility of resistance said Anthony Fauci MD director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Thats the reason why were uncomfortable when you only have a single drug that has been shown to have efficacy or youre proving that it has efficacy which is part of the clinical trial Fauci saidFaucis team is sponsoring a clinical trial that launched Sept 8 and plans to enroll 500 adults and children Researchers plan to evaluate the drugs safety and whether tecovirimat works better than placebo on healing time pain scores preventing people from progressing to severe monkeypox and more The risk of resistance will also be addressed in this trial Fauci said Future research will investigate other antiviral medications so there is more than one option especially if resistance to tecovirimat does emerge More 540000 doses of the Jynneos vaccine have been administered across 39 jurisdictions reporting data to the CDC Walensky said CDC data shows 47 of people getting a first dose are white 21 are Hispanic and 12 are Black Officials also report an increase in people receiving their second dose of Jynneos over the past few weeks The recommended time between the first and second vaccine dose is 28 days As a reminder Jynneos is a twodose vaccine and it is important to receive the second dose in the series to have the best protection against monkeypox Walensky said She added that current data suggests peak protection occurs 14 days after the second dose Its the early adopters or as Walensky describes them the people who roll up their sleeves before theyve reached the pharmacy that account for most vaccinations so far Officials recognize were entering a more challenging phase in terms of getting more reluctant people vaccinated as well In an effort to hunker down and go deeper into communities at risk the White House plans to build on their previous success with outreach at large pride events and expand the pilot program to smaller community events said Bob Fenton White House Monkeypox Response Coordinator Effective interventions hinge on targeting men of color as well which is part of the CDC Monkeypox Vaccine Equity Pilot Project We have also seen the racial and ethnic makeup of this outbreak evolve Walensky said At first monkeypox cases were reported in primarily nonHispanic white men In the past few weeks however the demographics have shifted Now nonHispanic white men account for 26 of cases nonHispanic black men for 38 and Hispanic or Latino men for 25 of casesAs weve said equity must remain the cornerstone of our response Daskalakis said In terms of vaccine research the NIAID is sponsoring a study to evaluate the effectiveness of administering the Jynneos vaccine between layers of skin instead of under the skin for protection against monkeypox As of Aug 10 the FDA allowed the splitting of a single dose of Jynneos typically given under the skin or subcutaneously into five doses given between layers of the skin or intradermally Now researchers are looking at the practices safety and efficacy further in the trial Data shows monkeypox does not travel alone so using existing services that focus on HIV and sexually transmitted infections in affected communities is another strategy to educate and reduce monkeypox Daskalakis said For example 38 of 1969 people diagnosed with monkeypox had HIV and 41 had an STI in the prior year according to a study published in the CDCs Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on Sept 9 We quickly use this data to change how monkeypox services can be supported by public health departments clinics and communitybased organizations Daskalakis said The same people we need to test for HIV and sexually transmitted infections and lead to prevention and care are the same people who need monkeypoxrelated services like testing education and vaccines This important change in guidance  allows our frontline health departments and communitybased organizations to use their HIV and STI resources to accelerate us all to the end of the monkeypox outbreak,real,0,VLPFN,0

FEMA Smart Guillotines Placed in FEMA Internment Camps video of readers think this story is Fact Add your two centsIf all information is accurate the Deep State using FEMA as its agent of evil is expediting plans to herd humans into internment camps The acquisition of smart guillotines is a portent of the Deep States hatred of America the American people and of the documentthe Constitutionour forefathers authored to protect us from the wicked machinations of the very government we elected into officeAll states have them but Texas got the majority right now our source saidThe 500 units were sent to FEMA camps near Austin a New World Orderin Waco and a FEMA internment camp disguised as a water treatment facility in CarroltonFEMAs main focus is on Texas All eyes on Texas If theres going to be a public insurrection they know the battle lines will be dawn in Texas They know the patriot community is thick in Texas Thats why Texas is receiving more of these smart guillotines than any other state FEMAs first strike will occur in Texas our source saidThe Andrews AFB shipmentover 500 smart guillotineswas distributed by rail to FEMA zone six an area encompassing Texas New Mexico Louisiana Oklahoma Belgrade and Arkansas primarily red states likely to resist a declaration of Martial Law or a military incursion against the American peopleAfter Obama left office FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security kept the smart guillotine project alive using slush funds and black project money to fund three thousand of the villainous devices each of which reportedly cost seventeen million dollars FEMA ordered them from the Chinese our source added because the agency felt guilty about using MadeinAmerica products to execute Americans In addition the Chinese versions are less costlyThe Deep State and by association FEMA recognized that some of its own peoples heads might accidentally wind up on the chopping block They had to devise a way to stop the blade from lopping off friendly heads So when a person is face down waiting for the blade to fall the computer scans the face and iris If it matches a friendly face stored in a database the blade wont fall and the person is set free our source saidIf a person resists arm and leg restraints spring forth from recessed compartments rendering the victim immobile Moreover the smart guillotines employ biometric scanning including facial recognition technology to exonerate persons mistakenly placed on the guillotine for executionFor example the headrest has motion sensors and pressure plates that detect the presence of a human neck No operator is needed a computer drops and retracts a razorsharp weighted titanium blade which our source said can sever several hundred heads per sharpeningThe condemned person is secured with stocks at the bottom of the frame positioning the neck directly below the blade The blade is then released to quickly fall and forcefully decapitate the victim with a single clean pass so that the head falls into a basket below The smart guillotine retains the basic design while adding several scientific advancementsThe guillotine gained popularity during the French Revolution The device consists of a tall upright frame in which a weighted and angled blade is raised to the top and suspendedHe said the smart guillotine project was commissioned in 2011 at the request of former president Barrack Hussein Obama who had hoped during his term toand use the deadly apparatus against patriots and freedom fighters that challenged his oneworld government agenda The guillotine he added is the ideal method of execution for instilling fear among the massesThe technologically advanced guillotines he said are being manufactured in Beijing before being flown exclusively to US airbases Then the

NIHfunded rodent study finds molecular link between adolescent alcohol use and adult anxietyNew preclinical research in rats has identified a link between adolescent alcohol exposure and specific molecular changes in the brain that contribute to increased anxiety in adulthood A large body of evidence demonstrates a strong relationship between alcohol and anxiety problems in humansThese findings provide insight into the mechanisms through which alcoholinduced brain changes during adolescence increase vulnerability to alcohol and anxiety problems in adulthood said George F Koob PhD director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism NIAAA part of the National Institutes of HealthThe new report is the latest installment of work led by NIAAA grantee Subhash C Pandey PhD professor and director of the NIAAAfunded Alcohol Research Center in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago and a Senior Research Career Scientist at Jesse Brown VA Medical Center in Chicago Dr Pandey and his colleagues have previously reported that rats exposed to alcohol during adolescence show greater anxietylike behavior as adults compared to nonalcohol exposed rats They have also shown that those effects were linked to two genes  brainderived neurotrophic factor Bdnf and activityregulated cytoskeletonassociated protein Arc  that nerve cells need to form new connections with each otherIn the current study the Pandey group focused on epigenetic changes that affect expression of the Arc protein in the amygdala a brain region linked to anxiety and alcohol misuse Epigenetic changes refer to DNA modifications that affect expression of a gene without altering the genes DNA sequence Specifically the researchers wanted to determine if expression of a relatively new class of genetic material known as enhancer RNA eRNA was influenced by adolescent alcohol exposure and if epigenetic mechanisms in turn influenced expression of the Arc eRNA and gene in the adult amygdala They also wanted to know whether this epigenetic mechanism played a role in anxietylike behavior in adult animals that were exposed to alcohol during adolescence A report of their findings is online in the journal Biological PsychiatryeRNAs are noncoding RNAs that do not encode into protein but regulate a target genes function thus representing crucial molecular events in gene expression explained Dr PandeyAs in their previous studies the researchers administered alcohol to adolescent rats using a binge drinkinglike model and examined the animals for anxietylike behaviors in adulthood including how blocking the activity of eRNAs specific to the Arc gene affected those behaviorsThey found that compared to adult animals without adolescent alcoholexposure the adolescent alcoholexposed rats displayed both decreased Arc eRNA expression and Arc gene expression in the amygdala as well as heightened anxietylike behavior in adulthood However a dose of alcohol reduced the anxietylike behavior and was associated with a reversal in Arc eRNA and Arc gene expression  suggesting that Arc contributes to anxietylike behaviorWe identified underlying epigenetic processes regulating Arc eRNA expression in adulthood that are affected by adolescent alcohol exposure said Dr Pandey Adolescent alcohol exposure produces persistent effects on eRNA related to Arc gene expression via epigenetic reprogramming and lower eRNA levels in the amygdala These effects in turn increased the susceptibility to anxiety in adulthoodLastly Dr Pandey and his colleagues showed that directly blocking Arc eRNA in the amygdala of control rats led to anxietylike behaviors demonstrating that Arc eRNA expression in the amygdala regulates anxietylike behaviorsThese findings provide a better understanding of how adolescent alcohol exposure can lead to lifelong biomolecular changes that increase the risk for adultonset psychiatric disorders said Dr PandeyFurther research is necessary to determine if these newly identified molecular targets might lead to the development of better therapies for pathologies related to adolescent alcohol exposureThis press release describes a basic research finding Basic research increases our understanding of human behavior and biology which is foundational to advancing new and better ways to prevent diagnose and treat disease Science is an unpredictable and incremental process  each research advance builds on past discoveries often in unexpected ways Most clinical advances would not be possible without the knowledge of

pt 6 2022  A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC reveals concerning findings about the effectiveness of COVID19 vaccines The study found that almost half of the people hospitalized with COVID19 last spring had received a third dose or booster shot raising questions about the efficacy of these additional doses Furthermore the report shows that unvaccinated adults were only 34 times more likely to be hospitalized with COVID19 compared to vaccinated individuals suggesting that the vaccines may not provide significant protection The study which analyzed hospitalization numbers from March 20 to May 31 during the dominance of the omicron subvariant BA2 found that 391 of patients had received a primary vaccination series and at least one booster or additional dose This raises concerns about the need for multiple doses and their effectiveness Additionally 5 of patients were fully vaccinated with two boosters indicating that even with multiple doses the vaccines may not provide adequate protection Despite these findings the CDC still recommends that adults stay up to date with COVID19 vaccination including booster doses However they also emphasize the importance of using multiple nonpharmaceutical and medical prevention measures to protect highrisk individuals regardless of vaccination status This highlights the limitations of vaccines in preventing severe cases The study also revealed that older adults and people with underlying medical conditions are more likely to be hospitalized if they become infected with the coronavirus This suggests that even vaccinated individuals are not fully protected Hospitalization rates among people over 65 increased threefold over the study period raising concerns about the effectiveness of vaccines in older populations Similarly hospitalization rates among people under 65 rose 17 times indicating that even younger individuals who are vaccinated may still be at risk These findings underscore the need for further research and caution when it comes to COVID19 vaccination While vaccines have played a crucial role in mitigating the impact of the pandemic it is important to acknowledge their limitations and explore additional preventive measures to protect public health,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt35

Oct 10 2022  As a doctor I was recently faced with a shocking revelation that exposed the troubling reality of our health care system for patients with disabilities A patient who required specialized care was unable to find a urologist willing to see her due to her wheelchairbound condition This eyeopening experience made me acutely aware of the challenges individuals with disabilities face when navigating the health care system Motivated to further examine this issue my colleagues and I conducted a comprehensive study to identify the obstacles and discriminatory attitudes that hinder access to adequate care for the millions of Americans with disabilitiesIn our study we interviewed a diverse group of doctors including primary care physicians and specialists Many of them acknowledged that their limited resources and training left them illequipped to provide proper care for patients with disabilities They expressed a lack of expertise time and space to accommodate these individuals effectively Coordinating care for patients with disabilities was a struggle and doctors were unsure about the necessary accessible equipment and how to utilize it properlyCompounding these challenges some doctors noted that they were not adequately reimbursed for the additional staff equipment and time required to provide the necessary accommodations for patients with disabilities This financial burden often led doctors to turn away these patients an unfortunate reality that further exacerbates the disparities in health outcomes for individuals with disabilitiesPrevious research has shown that people with disabilities experience worse health outcomes such as undetected cancer obesity and cardiovascular disease However our study suggests that the disability itself is not the sole cause of these disparities Instead explicit bias among healthcare providers plays a significant role This realization underscores the need for change on multiple levels within our healthcare systemAlthough our study is not conclusive it highlights a concerning pattern of more frequently denying care to individuals with disabilities compared to those without disabilities Patients with disabilities often encounter barriers to care such as a lack of necessary equipment and feeling unwelcome in healthcare facilities These findings support the urgent need for system and policy changes that prioritize accessibility and inclusivity for all patientsWhile largerscale research is required to fully understand the extent of doctor bias and discriminatory attitudes there are immediate steps that doctors and healthcare organizations can take to improve the situation Medical schools can enhance their curriculum to provide more exposure to patients with disabilities fostering greater empathy and understanding among future doctors Additionally doctors offices can implement training programs that teach staff to proactively inquire about necessary accommodations for all patientsBy making these changes we can slowly but surely move our healthcare system in the right direction ensuring that individuals with disabilities have equal access to quality care It is our collective responsibility to rewrite the current framework of healthcare in the United States setting a precedent for inclusivity and compassion,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_role
June 9 2022  As summer approaches concerns are growing over a potential surge in monkeypox cases across Europe The World Health Organization WHO has highlighted the role of large gatherings and festivals in the transmission of the virus WHO regional director for Europe Hans Henri P Kluge emphasized that further transmission in Europe and other regions is highly likely The United Kingdom has been heavily affected by the current monkeypox outbreak reporting the highest number of confirmed cases among 29 nations To address this issue the UK Health Security Agency UKHSA has made monkeypox a notifiable disease in EnglandInterestingly the WHO has identified an unexpected pattern in the transmission of monkeypox While the virus can affect anyone it is currently being transmitted through social networks primarily linked to sexual activity particularly among men who have sex with men Kluge commended the gay and bisexual communities for their high awareness of health and their proactive approach in seeking healthcare services when symptomatic In light of the WHOs warning the UKHSA has taken decisive measures to contain the spread of monkeypox as the summer season begins The agency has collaborated with various organizations to raise awareness about the disease The initial campaign targeted London as epidemiological data showed that the capital accounted for the majority of monkeypox cases in England By partnering with LGBT organizations like Stonewall and sexual health provider the Terence Higgins Trust the UKHSA aimed to reach out to the most atrisk population This effort was followed by a national rollout which included inapp advertisements on the popular gay and bisexual dating platform Grindr to raise awareness about the risk of contracting the monkeypox virusMoreover the UKHSA has partnered with Do It London to organize a radio ad campaign on Gaydio and offered support to Pride events in the capital to spread public health messaging To ensure the safety of event venues the UKHSA is working with health protection bodies and sexual health stakeholders to develop a toolkit containing cleaning protocols and vaccination guidelines for close contacts of monkeypox casesOverall the collaboration between the UKHSA and various organizations along with the proactive engagement of the gay and bisexual communities has been pivotal in raising awareness about monkeypox and preventing its further spread The WHOs identification of festivals and large gatherings as potential risk contexts serves as an opportunity to engage with young sexually active individuals and promote awareness about the disease It is crucial to remain vigilant and take necessary precautions to protect ourselves and our communities during this festival season,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_role
Preliminary results of a Phase 3 randomized placebocontrolled clinical trial testing the investigative monoclonal antibody LYCoV555 in hospitalized COVID19 patients were published today in The New England Journal of Medicine The antibody did not provide clinical benefit compared to placebo The trial which had been halted to new enrollment in late October following a recommendation by the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board DSMB is part of the Accelerating COVID19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines ACTIV program The trial is sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of the National Institutes of HealthThe ACTIV3 trial used a master protocol designed to allow study of multiple investigational agents compared to placebo in adults hospitalized with COVID19 Participants in ACTIV3 are randomly assigned to receive either an experimental agent or a matched placebo All participants also receive standard of care for patients hospitalized with COVID19 including the antiviral remdesivir Five days after enrollment participants clinical status is assessed based on an ordinal scale If the investigational agent appears to be safe and effective based on an evaluation of the first 300 participants stage 1 an additional 700 participants are randomized and followed for 90 days to assess sustained recovery defined as being discharged alive and home for 14 days stage 2 Patients with endstage organ failure are not enrolled in stage 1 but such patients are allowed to enroll if the trial proceeds to stage 2The first agent evaluated in ACTIV3 was LYCoV555 The monoclonal antibody was discovered by AbCellera Biologics based in Vancouver in collaboration with NIAIDs Vaccine Research Center Subsequently it was developed and manufactured by Indianapolisbased Lilly Research Laboratories Eli Lilly and Company in partnership with AbCelleraThe trial was closed to new enrollees on October 26 after the DSMB reviewed data from stage 1 of the trial and recommended that no further participants be randomized to receive LYCoV555 and that the investigators be unblinded to the data This recommendation was based on a low likelihood that the intervention would be of clinical value in this population of hospitalized patients without endstage organ failure Enrollment in the LYCoV555 substudy closed with 326 total participants 314 of whom were randomized to receive either LYCoV555 163 participants or placebo 151 participants After five days 50 of LYCoV555 recipients and 54 of placebo recipients were in one of the two most favorable outcome categories The investigators concluded that LYCoV555 did not accelerate clinical improvement compared to placebo at day 5 using the ordinal scale among hospitalized COVID19 patients without endstage organ failure Likewise there was no difference in either time to hospital discharge or the primary outcome of sustained recovery back at home for 14 days among recipients of LYCoV555 compared to placeboAlthough LYCoV555 did not perform better than placebo in the hospitalized COVID19 patients studied in this trial this same investigational monoclonal antibody was granted an Emergency Use Authorization EUA by the US Food and Drug Administration in November The EUA authorized use of LYCoV555 in nonhospitalized adolescents and adults with mild to moderate COVID19 symptoms who are at elevated risk of progressing to severe COVID19 diseaseThe ACTIV3 trial is being conducted at hospitals worldwide that are part of existing clinical trials networks The lead

June 14 2022  A study published last week linking the consumption of fish to melanoma had sushi eaters looking up the number of the nearest dermatologist But experts said the findings had several important limitations and that no one should change their diet based on the results It wouldnt impact my fish consumption at all said Sancy Leachman MD who directs the melanoma program at Oregon Health  Science Universitys Knight Cancer Institute in Portland Fish are part of a healthy diet particularly if it replaces less healthy proteins such as beef Even the authors of the study advised caution when interpreting the findings I wouldnt encourage anyone to change their fish consumption habits just because of this paper said study leader Eunyoung Cho ScD an epidemiologist at Brown University in Providence RI Fish is cardioprotective and is related to reduced risk of developing certain cancers too The study quickly generated headlines and was the most viewed article of the journal Cancer Causes  Control within a day of its publication on June 9 Cho who is on the editorial board of the journal analyzed the results of a study funded by the National Institutes of Health NIH and Association for the Advancement of Retired Persons AARP that began in the 1990s and explored possible links between fish consumption and developing different forms of cancer Previous research from this project had shown eating fish was associated with an increased risk of melanoma  but no other type of cancer Cho speculated that the risk is due to contaminants such as mercury and arsenic in fish But she was curious to see if she could find a connection between the amount of fish consumed and the risk of developing skin cancer At the beginning of the study people reported how much fish they had consumed over the previous year which varied widely by person Then researchers tracked participants for 15 years counting who developed cancer and who did not Dietary recall can be difficult people often say they cant remember what they ate yesterday much less 1 year ago Still dietitian Clare Collins PhD of the University of Newcastle in Australia noted that previous research showed that the dietary recall tool for this study is reliableNIH researchers never checked to see how their diet changed over time as this was a study meant to observe changes in health status starting from a baseline point The researchers assumed that the level of fish intake recorded at the beginning of the study remained steady Of 491000 people tracked in the study 5000 developed malignant melanoma and another 3300 developed melanoma cells on the skin surface People who ate the most fish  an average of about 15 ounces per day  were 23 more likely to develop melanoma than the lightest fish eaters who averaged 01 ounces per day That risk is modest Leachman said especially for people with red hair who she said are 400 more likely to get melanoma than others A 23 increase in the whole scheme of things is not nearly as important as not getting sunburned if youre a redhead Leachman said And what about the sun Sun exposure is the principal risk factor for developing melanoma and the researchers didnt account for that factor People who developed melanoma during the study may simply have spent more time in tanning beds or on the beach  or perhaps fishing and then eating their catch Cho and colleagues tried to consider the effects of solar radiation by looking at average sun exposure times in the places where the participants in the study were living when the research began Using that framework variation in sun exposure made no difference to melanoma risk but Leachman said the technique isnt foolproof They assumed that they were going to get a certain amount of ultraviolet light just based on where they lived We dont know how long they lived there or if they really had ultraviolet exposure or not Leachman said Someone in presumably less sunny Pennsylvania could get more sun than someone in sundrenched Arizona depending on their lifestyle and habits The kind of study Cho published cannot account for individual behaviors related to sun exposure a limitation her team readily acknowledges Nor does it include information about moles or hair color  important considerations for skin cancers It may be that redheads with moles who barely ate any fish developed melanoma at higher rates than anyone else but the data dont allow for that kind of analysisChos group found that canned tuna and any type of fish that wasnt fried were associated with a higher risk of developing melanoma as people reported eating more of those products However people who said they ate greater quantities of fried fish had a lower risk of melanoma a counterintuitive finding that she said warrants further research Given that the study showed only a modest chance of developing melanoma regardless of fish intake and left so many questions unanswered what was the point Other journals declined to publish this paper Cho acknowledged but she defended the article as a step toward better understanding the health impact of environmental contaminants in fish Leachman agreed These kinds of studies are very important to do They have large data sets where you can start to see trends that may be important she said They can help you identify things that might be related These experiments are hypothesis generating I already published an article showing that total mercury level is related to skin cancer and we know very well that in the US fish consumption is the major source of mercury contamination Cho said So I naturally thought that fish consumption may be associated with increased risk of skin cancer too Cho said she believed the findings confirm that hypothesis Cho said the next step would be to measure blood levels of different contaminants such as mercury and arsenic in people with melanoma to determine which toxin is the biggest driver of melanoma She said she plans to seek funding for that research Meanwhile pass the salmon  but go light on the salt,real,0,VLPFN,0
New Study Reveals the Devastating Effects of Stress on RelationshipsA recent study published in Social Psychological and Personality Science has shed light on the detrimental impact of stress on romantic relationships The research suggests that when individuals are feeling stressed they are more likely to focus on their partners negative behaviors rather than their positive onesPrevious studies have already shown that stressful life circumstances can influence how couples interact and behave However this new study goes a step further indicating that stress can also affect what people notice in the first place It seems that when individuals are stressed they become more attuned to their partners annoying impatient or critical behaviorsLead study author Lisa Neff PhD and her colleagues conducted a daily diary study with 79 heterosexual newlywed couples to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences The couples completed a short survey each night for 10 days documenting both their own and their partners behavior Before the study they also provided information about the stressful events in their livesThe findings revealed that couples who had recently experienced more stressful life events were particularly sensitive to their partners negative behaviors while ignoring their positive ones These individuals also perceived their partner as causing more negativity overall compared to those who had fewer stressful eventsWhat makes these results even more significant is that the study focused on newlyweds Typically couples in the early stages of marriage tend to focus on the positive aspects of their relationship and overlook the negative However this study suggests that stress can disrupt this honeymoon period and lead to a heightened focus on negative behaviorsDr Neff believes that further research should explore whether the harmful effects of stress are even stronger among couples who are no longer in the newlywed phase of their relationships It is crucial to understand the longterm consequences of stress on couples wellbeingImportantly the study found that a single stressful day did not cause partners to focus on their significant others negative behavior Instead it was the accumulation of stressful life circumstances over time that led to this shift in focusIn light of the ongoing pandemic and the lingering stress it has caused these findings are particularly relevant Dr Neff warns that if stress continues to direct individuals attention towards their partners inconsiderate behaviors it can take a significant toll on the relationshipWhile the study raises important questions about the potential impact of stress on relationships it remains unclear whether couples can correct this behavior even if they are aware of the effects of stress in their lives Further research is needed to explore potential interventions and strategies for couples to navigate the challenges posed by stressIn conclusion this study highlights the devastating effects of stress on relationships and emphasizes the need for individuals and couples to prioritize their mental wellbeing in order to maintain healthy and fulfilling partnerships,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt35
National Institutes of Health scientists studying the progression of inherited and infectious eye diseases that can cause blindness have found that microglia a type of nervous system cell suspected to cause retinal damage surprisingly had no damaging role during prion disease in mice In contrast the study findings indicated that microglia might delay disease progressionThe discovery could apply to studies of inherited photoreceptor degeneration diseases in people known as retinitis pigmentosa In retinitis pigmentosa cases scientists find an influx of microglia near the photoreceptors which led to the belief that microglia contribute to retina damageThese inherited diseases appear to damage the retina similarly to prion diseases Prion diseases are slow degenerative diseases of the central nervous system that occur in people and various other mammals No vaccines or treatments are available and the diseases are almost always fatal Prion diseases primarily involve the brain but also can affect the retina and other tissuesExpanding on work published in 2018 scientists at NIHs National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID used an experimental drug to eliminate microglia in prioninfected mice They studied prion disease progression in the retina to see if they could discover additional details that might be obscured in the more complex structure of the brainWhen the scientists examined their prioninfected study mice they found that photoreceptor damage still occurred  even somewhat faster  despite the absence of microglia They also observed early signs of new prion disease in the photoreceptor cells which may provide clues as to how prions damage photoreceptors Their work appears in Acta Neuropathologica CommunicationsThe NIAID scientists located at Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton Mont plan to continue to study the toxic interactions between prions and photoreceptor cells to identify ways to block these damaging effects They also plan to continue studying the role of microglia in deterring the initiation of prion diseaseJ Striebel et al Microglia are not required for prioninduced retinal photoreceptor degeneration Acta Neuropathologica Communications DOI 101186s404780190702x 2019J Carroll et al Microglia are critical in host defense against prion disease Journal of Virology DOI 101128JVI0054918 2018Bruce Chesebro MD chief of the NIAID Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases is available to comment on this studyThis press release describes a basic research finding Basic research increases our understanding of human behavior and biology which is foundational to advancing new and better ways to prevent diagnose and treat disease Science is an unpredictable and incremental process  each research advance builds on past discoveries often in unexpected ways Most clinical advances would not be possible without the knowledge of fundamental basic researchNIAID conducts and supports research  at NIH throughout the United States and worldwide  to study the causes of infectious and immunemediated diseases and to develop better means of preventing diagnosing and treating these illnesses News releases fact sheets and other NIAIDrelated materials are available on the NIAID websiteAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,real,0,VLPFN,0
MERS antibodies produced in cattle safe treatment well tolerated in Phase 1 trialAn experimental treatment developed from cattle plasma for Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS coronavirus infection shows broad potential according to a small clinical trial led by National Institutes of Health scientists and their colleagues The treatment SAB301 was safe and well tolerated by healthy volunteers with only minor reactions documentedThe first confirmed case of MERS was reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 Since then the MERS coronavirus has spread to 27 countries and sickened more than 2000 people of whom about 35 percent have died according to the World Health Organization There are no licensed treatments for MERSSAB301 was developed by SAB Biotherapeutics of Sioux Falls South Dakota and has been successfully tested in mice The treatment comes from socalled transchromosomic cattle These cattle have genes that have been slightly altered to enable them to produce fully human antibodies instead of cow antibodies against killed microbes with which they have been vaccinated  in this case the MERS virus The clinical trial conducted by NIHs National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases took place at the NIH Clinical CenterIn the study 28 healthy volunteers were treated with SAB301 and 10 received a placebo Six groups of volunteers given different intravenous doses were assessed six times over 90 days Complaints among the treatment and placebo groups  such as headache and common cold symptoms  were similar and generally mildThe researchers believe they may be able to use transchromosomic cattle to rapidly produce human antibodies against other human pathogens as well in as few as three months This means they could conceivably develop antibody treatments against a variety of infectious diseases in a much faster timeframe and in much greater volume than currently possibleJ Beigel et al Safety and tolerability of a novel polyclonal human antiMERS coronavirus antibody a phase 1 randomised doubleblind singledoseescalation study The Lancet Infectious Diseases DOI 101016S1473309918300021 2018Richard Davey MD Deputy Clinical Director NIAID is available to comment on this studyThis research was supported by HHS contract awards HHSN261200800001E HHSN272201100022I and HSO100201600020CNIAID conducts and supports research  at NIH throughout the United States and worldwide  to study the causes of infectious and immunemediated diseases and to develop better means of preventing diagnosing and treating these illnesses News releases fact sheets and other NIAIDrelated materials are available on the NIAID websiteAbout the National Institutes of Health NIH NIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic clinical and translational medical research and is investigating the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,real,0,VLPFN,0
Phase 1 clinical trial of a new influenza vaccine raises concerns about safety and effectivenessA Phase 1 clinical trial of a new influenza vaccine has recently started at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda Maryland The trial aims to test the safety and immune response of a candidate vaccine called BPL1357 However there are growing concerns about the potential risks and side effects associated with this vaccineThe vaccine candidate developed by researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID is a wholevirus vaccine made up of four strains of noninfectious chemically inactivated lowpathogenicity avian flu virus While preclinical studies showed promising results there are doubts about the validity of these findingsAnimal studies conducted by NIAID investigators demonstrated that mice and ferrets vaccinated with BPL1357 survived exposure to different influenza virus strains However the relevance of these findings to human immune responses is questionableIn the Phase 1 trial volunteers will be randomized into three groups and receive two doses of either placebo or the BPL1357 vaccine The study duration for each participant is approximately seven months during which they will provide blood and nasal mucosal samples to detect and characterize immune responses However it is important to note that this trial has limitations and may not provide conclusive evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of the vaccineFurthermore there are concerns about the longlasting protection provided by the BPL1357 vaccine against seasonal influenza viruses While the scientific community is hopeful there is no guarantee that this vaccine will be a valuable public health toolIn conclusion the Phase 1 clinical trial of the BPL1357 influenza vaccine raises concerns about its safety and effectiveness The potential risks and limitations of the study should be carefully considered before drawing any conclusions Further research is needed to determine the true efficacy of this vaccine in providing longlasting protection against seasonal influenza viruses,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt35

NIHfunded clinical trial shows risk is similar whether or not a cloudy lens is replaced with a lens implant Study suggests lifelong monitoring is crucial to preventing glaucomarelated vision lossChildren who undergo cataract surgery as infants have a 22 risk of glaucoma 10 years later whether or not they receive an intraocular lens implant The findings come from the National Eye Institute NEIfunded Infant Aphakic Treatment Study which today published 10year followup results in JAMA Ophthalmology NEI is part of the National Institutes of HealthThese findings underscore the need for longterm glaucoma surveillance among infant cataract surgery patients They also provide some measure of assurance that it is not necessary to place an intraocular lens at the time of cataract surgery said Michael F Chiang MD director of NEIThe results challenge the notion that replacing the childs lens with an implanted one protects the child from developing glaucoma a belief among some pediatric ophthalmology surgeons said the trials principal investigator Scott R Lambert MD professor of ophthalmology at Stanford University Palo Alto CaliforniaAt the time of cataract removal the 114 study participants ages 16 months had been born with cataract in one eye In the operating room the infants were randomly assigned to receive an artificial lens implant or go without a lens a condition called aphakiaAnnually fewer than 2500 children in the US are born with cataract a clouding of the eyes lens Surgery is used to remove and replace the cloudy lens To allow the childs eye to focus light properly following removal of the cataract an intraocular lens implant may be placed at surgery or the eye may be left aphakic and a contact lens or glasses if both eyes have had a cataract removed may be used to provide the needed correctionI tell patients parents that implanting a lens in the infants eye is like buying your childs wedding shoes when theyre an infant It is hard to predict what final power the intraocular lens should have without knowing how that eye will grow over the years so placing a lens at the time of cataract removal in an infant involves estimation and may not turn out to be correct Hence the eye may end up needing strong glasses or even replacement of the original lens implant said the lead author on the paper Sharon F Freedman MD a pediatric glaucoma specialist at Duke University Durham North CarolinaChildren who undergo cataract removal have an increased risk of glaucoma a sightthreatening condition that damages the optic nervethe connection between the eye and brain Scientists speculate that surgery to remove the cataract interferes with the maturation of how fluid flows out of the infants eye leading to increased eye pressure and optic nerve damage in some of these eyesAmong the 110 children who were available for reexamination at 10 years 25 eyes 24 had developed glaucoma and 21 eyes 20 were glaucoma suspects due to elevated eye pressure However visual acuity was similar among those eyes that developed glaucoma compared to those eyes that had not The researchers found no evidence of glaucomarelated eye damage assessed by imaging of the optic nerve head to measure the retinal nerve fiber layer thicknessThe investigators attribute the absence of glaucomarelated eye damage to close patient monitoring as any sign of glaucoma was aggressively treatedWhile the lifetime glaucoma risk trajectory for patients who have cataract removal as infants remains unknown this study found that the risk of glaucoma after cataract removal rose from 9 at 1 year to 17 at 5 years and to 22 at 10 yearsAny child who has had a cataract removed needs to be seen by an eye care provider once a year at a minimum said Freedman Any child diagnosed with glaucoma or abovenormal intraocular pressure without signs of ocular damage  what we called glaucoma suspect  should be monitored every four to six months depending upon the stability of the condition and the health of the eyeAt 10 years 40 of the followed children had developed the diagnosis of glaucoma or glaucoma suspect A glaucoma suspect is an eye that has above normal eye pressure or another feature suspicious but not diagnostic of glaucomaThe findings also confirm that the timing of cataract surgery is a balancing act Whereas surgery at younger ages increases glaucoma risk delaying surgery increases risk of amblyopia a leading cause of visual impairment in children that results when cataract in one eye causes the brain to ignore signals from that eye and favor the other eyeFuture studies of glaucoma following cataract surgery in children will benefit from groundwork by the Infant Aphakic Treatment Study Freedman said collaboration among the 12 study centers defined diagnostic standards for pediatric glaucoma and glaucoma suspect and criteria for glaucomarelated adverse events This cohort began the process leading to an international

NIHsupported researchers find link between allergen in red meat and heart diseaseA team of researchers says it has linked sensitivity to an allergen in red meat to the buildup of plaque in the arteries of the heart While high saturated fat levels in red meat have long been known to contribute to heart disease for people in general the new finding suggests that a subgroup of the population may be at heightened risk for a different reason  a food allergen The study which is supported by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute part of the National Institutes of Health appears in Arteriosclerosis Thrombosis and Vascular Biology ATVB a peerreviewed journal of the American Heart AssociationThis novel finding from a small group of subjects from Virginia raises the intriguing possibility that allergy to red meat may be an underrecognized factor in heart disease said study leader Coleen McNamara MD a professor of medicine in the Cardiovascular Research Center of the University of Virginia Health System Charlottesville These preliminary findings underscore the need for further clinical studies in larger populations from diverse geographic regions and additional laboratory workThe number of people with red meat allergies in the United States is unclear but researchers estimate that it may be 1 percent of the population in some areas The number of people who develop blood antibodies to the red meat allergen without having fullblown symptoms is much higher  as much as 20 percent of the population in some areas the researchers sayOnly in recent years did scientists identify the main allergen in red meat called galactose13galactose or alphaGal a type of complex sugar They also found that a tick  the Lone Star tick  sensitizes people to this allergen when it bites them That is why red meat allergies tend to be more common where these ticks are more prevalent such as the Southeastern United States but also extending to other areas including Long Island New YorkResearchers have suspected for some time that allergens can trigger certain immunological changes that might be associated with plaque buildup and artery blockages but no one had identified a specific substance that is responsible for this effect In the current study researchers showed for the first time that a specific blood marker for red meat allergy was associated with higher levels of arterial plaque or fatty deposits on the inner lining of the arteries The blood marker they identified is a type of antibody immunoglobulin or IgE that is specific to the alphaGal allergen To identify this blood marker the researchers analyzed blood samples from 118 adults and detected antibodies to alphaGal indicating sensitivity to red meat in 26 percent of them Using an imaging procedure the researchers found that the quantity of plaque was 30 percent higher in the alphaGal sensitized patients than in the nonsensitized patients These plaques a hallmark of atherosclerosis hardening of the arteries also tended to be more structurally unstable which means that they have an increased likelihood of causing heart attack and strokeThe evidence for a link between red meat allergens and coronary artery disease is still preliminary the researchers noted so they plan to conduct detailed animal and human studies to confirm their initial findings Currently the only treatment for red meat allergy once it is diagnosed is strict avoidance of red meat While more studies are needed the current work provides a potential new approach or target for preventing or treating heart disease in a subgroup of people who are sensitized to red meat said Ahmed Hasan MD PhD a medical officer and program director in NHLBIs Atherothrombosis  Coronary Artery Disease Branch For now consumers are encouraged to follow current recommendations for a hearthealthy lifestyle This includes adapting a healthy diet such as eating plenty of vegetables fruits whole grains and other hearthealthy foods Lean red meats can be part of a heart healthy diet for those who are not allergic Other hearthealthy lifestyle changes also include aiming for a healthy weight managing stress getting more exercise and quitting smokingIn addition to funding from NHLBI this study was also funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID NIH funding support includes

The Length of COVID19 Infectiousness Still Unknown Creating UncertaintyMay 31 2022  After more than two years of dealing with the COVID19 pandemic there is still uncertainty regarding how long individuals remain infectious according to a report by The Wall Street JournalContrary to previous expectations some individuals continue to test positive with rapid tests beyond the typical fiveday period There are even cases where individuals test positive after 10 days raising concerns about their contagiousness during the later stages of the infectionNathaniel Hafer the director of operations for the University of Massachusetts Center for Clinical and Translational Science stated that the question of whether people are infectious at the end of their infection period is still a topic of debate among scientistsLast year the CDC decided to shorten the quarantine and isolation guidelines suggesting that individuals who test positive should isolate for five days If they are asymptomatic at that time they may leave isolation as long as they continue to wear masks for an additional five days to minimize the risk of infecting othersHealth experts however caution that adhering to these guidelines might result in individuals leaving isolation while they are still contagious especially if they do not wait for a negative rapid test Carina Marquez an associate professor and infectiousdisease doctor at the University of California San Francisco believes that people are returning to work while still infectious even if they appear to be feeling better Marquez herself tested positive for 13 days while working remotely illustrating the potential risks involved in this situation,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_all

Annual Report to the Nation Part 2 Patient economic burden of cancer care more than 21 billion in the United States in 2019Part two of the latest Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer finds that cancer patients in the United States shoulder a large amount of cancer care costs In 2019 the national patient economic burden associated with cancer care was 2109 billion made up of patient outofpocket costs of 1622 billion and patient time costs of 487 billion Patient time costs reflect the value of time that patients spend traveling to and from health care waiting for care and receiving care according to the reportThe report appearing October 26 2021 in JNCI The Journal of the National Cancer Institute is the most comprehensive examination of patient economic burden for cancer care to date and includes information on patient outofpocket spending by cancer site stage of disease at diagnosis and phase of care While this analysis is about the costs that are directly incurred by patients which are critical to patient finances the total overall costs of cancer care and lost productivity in the United States are much largerAmong adults aged 65 years and older who had Medicare coverage average annualized net outofpocket costs for medical services and prescription drugs across all cancer sites were highest in the initial phase of care defined as the first 12 months following diagnosis 2200 and 243 respectively and the endoflife phase defined as the 12 months before death among survivors who died 3823 and 448 respectively and lowest in the continuing phase the months between the initial and endoflife phases 466 and 127 respectively Across all cancer sites average annualized net patient outofpocket costs for medical services in the initial and endoflife phases of care were lowest for patients originally diagnosed with localized disease compared with more advanced stage diseaseAs the costs of cancer treatment continue to rise greater attention to addressing patient medical financial hardship including difficulty paying medical bills high levels of financial distress and delaying care or forgoing care altogether because of cost is warranted said Karen E Knudsen MBA PhD chief executive officer American Cancer Society These findings can help inform efforts to minimize the patient economic burden of cancer and specific estimates may be useful in studies of the costeffectiveness of interventions related to cancer prevention diagnosis treatment and survivorship careThe annual report is a collaborative effort among the American Cancer Society the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC the National Cancer Institute NCI part of the National Institutes of Health and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries The report provides annual information about cancer occurrence and trends in the United States Part 1 of this annual report released in July 2021 focused on national cancer statisticsAnalyses of the differences in patient economic burden by cancer type found substantial variation in patient outofpocket costs reflecting differences in treatment intensity and duration as well as survival In 2019 national outofpocket costs were highest for breast 314 billion prostate 226 billion colorectal 146 billion and lung 135 billion cancers reflecting the higher prevalence of these cancersIn the modern era of cancer research we have to think about treatment costs and how they impact our patients As exciting and promising as cancer research is we are keenly aware of the issue of financial toxicity for these patients said Norman E Ned Sharpless MD director of NCI Therapies that are highly effective are no doubt good news but if they are unaffordable it is not the total kind of progress we would like to see Finding ways to ensure that not just some but all patients get access to therapies that are beneficial to them is an important goal we must continue to strive for in the cancer community This report will help guide us toward achieving that goalThe cost of having cancer is enormous and an extreme burden on people and families particularly for those who are uninsured or underinsured Prevention is key to lowering outofpocket costs said Karen Hacker MD MPH director of CDCs National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Unfortunately we know that many of these same people also have lower cancer screening use and may end up paying more for their cancer care Access to the right cancer screening tests at the right time is an important step toward health equity and we must work to make this a realityThe authors say that in addition to morbidity and mortality from cancer and cost of cancer treatment by insurance carriers outofpocket and patient time costs are other metrics that highlight the immense economic burden of cancermaking it a public health priority Estimates of patient outofpocket and time costs can inform discussions between providers and patients about expected costs of treatment an important element of highquality careFor more information about the report see httpsseercancergovreporttonationAbout the National Cancer Institute NCI NCI

Nov 4 2022  Alcohol deaths spiked during the first year of the COVID19 pandemic with the ageadjusted rate of alcoholinduced deaths increasing 26 from 2019 to 2020 the CDC reported Friday About 49000 people died from alcoholrelated reasons in 2020 rising from around 39000 in the previous year Alcohol caused 131 deaths for every 100000 people in 2020 up from 104 deaths for every 100000 people in 2019 the CDC said citing data from the National Vital Statistics System Alcohol deaths have gone up about 7 a year from 2000 to 2018 the CDC said but the isolation and fear caused by the pandemic apparently caused people to drink more We know that in largescale traumatic events to the population  like 911 or Hurricane Katrina  people historically start drinking more The pandemic has been as we all know a major stressor to our lives George F Koob PhD director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism told CNNWhat weve been picking up with numerous small studies is that about 25 of the population increased their drinking and these individuals were people who were drinking to cope with stress And many people who drink to cope with stress inevitably go on to have an alcohol use disorder The death rate was highest for men in the 55to64 age group with about 60 deaths for every 100000 people the CDC said For women the highest death rate also occurred in the 55to64 age group with about 21 deaths per 100000 people For men in all age groups alcohol deaths per 100000 people went from 152 in 2019 to 192 in 2020 For women in all age groups those deaths rose from 59 to 75 over that time period Deaths rose 50 from alcoholinduced acute pancreatitis 33 from mental and behavioral disorders due to use of alcohol and 23 from alcoholic liver disease the CDC said The report covers deaths directly related to drinking such as alcoholic liver disease and alcohol poisoning Not included were unintentional injuries homicides and deaths indirectly or partially related to alcohol use the CDC said,real,0,VLPFN,0
The National Institutes of Healths Health Care Systems HCS Research Collaboratory which involves health care systems in conducting largescale clinical studies has announced five new research awards  totaling 415 million for a oneyear planning phase with an estimated 3085 million expected for four subsequent years of study implementation The HCS Research Collaboratory was developed by the NIH Common Fund in 2012 and is administered by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health NCCIH and the National Institute on Aging NIA The HCS Research Collaboratory is currently supporting nine largescale clinical trials with health care systems across the United States and a collaboratory coordinating center at Duke University Durham North Carolina The ongoing trials focus on many different diseases including colon cancer chronic pain kidney failure hospitalacquired infections suicide prevention and multiple chronic medical conditionsHealth care systems which include health maintenance organizations and other large integrated care settings see large populations of patients Through these collaborative research projects NIH is also able to conduct largescale and costeffective clinical research on a variety of diseases within the settings where patients are already receiving their careThe collaboratory program pioneered efforts at NIH to conduct largescale clinical trials within health care systems and we are excited about expanding this initiative said David Shurtleff PhD NCCIH acting director Conducting clinical trials in realworld settings is a critical aspect of the collaboratory programThis kind of transNIH collaboration is important as we test interventions on a large scale and in real world clinical care settings said Richard J Hodes MD

Sept 6 2022  Despite the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions claim that almost half the people who were hospitalized with COVID19 last spring had been fully vaccinated and received a third dose or booster shot new research suggests that the vaccines may not be as effective as previously thoughtUnvaccinated adults were 34 times more likely to be hospitalized with COVID than those who were vaccinated the CDC said However the study found that the vaccines may not be providing the level of protection that was expected with many fully vaccinated individuals still being hospitalized with the virusThe CDC report considered hospitalization numbers from March 20 to May 31 when the omicron subvariant BA2 was the dominant strain Researchers found that 391 of patients had received a primary vaccination series and at least one booster or additional dose 5 were fully vaccinated with two boostersAdults should stay up to date with COVID19 vaccination including booster doses the CDC said Multiple nonpharmaceutical and medical prevention measures should be used to protect persons at high risk for severe SARSCoV2 regardless of vaccination statusOlder adults and people with underlying medical conditions who become infected with the coronavirus are more likely to be hospitalized The study also found that hospitalization rates among people over 65 increased threefold over the study period Rates among people under 65 rose 17 timesWhile the CDC recommends booster doses for adults the effectiveness of the vaccines may be questionable as many fully vaccinated individuals are still being hospitalized with COVID19 It is important for adults to consider their options and make informed decisions about their health,llm fake,2,VLPFN,vicuna
A genetic variant found only in people of African descent significantly increases a smokers preference for cigarettes containing menthol a flavor additive The variant of the MRGPRX4 gene is five to eight times more frequent among smokers who use menthol cigarettes than other smokers according to an international group of researchers supported by the US Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health The multiethnic study is the first to look across all genes to identify genetic vulnerability to menthol cigarettes The paper was published online in the journal PLOS Genetics on Feb 15However the studys findings should be taken with a grain of salt While the genetic variant may increase the preference for menthol cigarettes it does not necessarily mean that menthol cigarettes are safer or healthier than other cigarettes In fact the FDA has announced plans to propose a ban on mentholflavored cigarettes and cigars citing the high use of menthol cigarettes among youth and young adultsMenthol provides a minty taste and a cooling or soothing sensation making it a popular choice among smokers The studys findings suggest that the genetic variant may play a role in the preference for menthol cigarettes among people of African descent However it is important to note that smoking is a harmful habit that can lead to serious health problems regardless of the type of cigarette smokedIt is also worth noting that the study was supported by the US Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health two organizations that are committed to protecting public health The FDA has sought public commentary and scientific information on the use of menthol in tobacco products and has announced plans to propose a ban on mentholflavored cigarettes and cigarsIn conclusion while the genetic variant may increase the preference for menthol cigarettes among people of African descent it is important to remember that smoking is a harmful habit that can lead to serious health problems The FDA has announced plans to propose a ban on mentholflavored cigarettes and cigars and it is important for smokers to consider the risks associated with smoking regardless of the type of cigarette smoked,llm fake,2,VLPFN,vicuna
The 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was bestowed upon James P Allison and Tasuku Honjo marking a new era in cancer treatment Their research according to The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has established the potential of the immune system to combat tumor cells However it is pertinent to question are we ready to embrace this new treatmentDr Allison from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston Texas has targeted a protein CTLA4 which essentially hinders the immune system from functioning at maximum capacity particularly when cancerous cells are present Indicatively though he has defied this natural brake through antibodies the risks associated with such a shift especially in an overreactive immune system have been overlooked and require thorough examinationA similar approach to unlock the immune system has been implemented by Dr Honjo of Kyoto University Institute through another protein However their offerings of a novel mechanism have resulted in a flurry of new checkpoint inhibitors hastily developed with potential longterm adverse effects yet to be identifiedOne cannot ignore the substantial NIH funding of 137 million bestowed upon Dr Allison Could the funds have been directed to other conventional treatment methods that warrant more scrutiny for cancer patientsWith great admiration officials from the NIH quote the findings to be the fourth modality of cancer therapy leaving us to wonder if such an endeavor is unnecessary extravagance or a real boon to the medical worldThe commendation of Dr Allisons research spanning four decades indeed appears captivating but raises questions about its longterm applicability to cancer Will it prove beneficial in the long run or should we tread more cautiously with breakthroughs that promise the moon In the pursuit of advancements its important to maintain a balance between embracing the new and holding onto proven methods It remains to be seen in which category this groundbreaking research will ultimately fall,llm fake,2,VLPFN,gpt4
Mar 18 2023  The leader of the World Health Organization said Friday that he expects the organization to declare an end to the COVID19 pandemic later this year because statistics on the virus keep declining I am confident that this year we will be able to say that COVID19 is over as a public health emergency of international concern WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters at a Geneva briefing For the first time the weekly number of reported COVID deaths over a fourweek period was lower than when WHO declared COVID a global pandemic three years ago We are certainly in a much better position now than we have been at any time during the pandemic said Ghebreyesus In January Ghebreyesus said the pandemic was probably at a transition point meaning public health measures could be further deescalated In the United States COVIDrelated statistics have gone up and down over the last three years as different strains of the virus dominate but the numbers are now trending downwardA CDC chart shows there were 1706 weekly deaths as of March 15 of this year Thats the lowest number of weekly deaths since March 25 2020 when there were 1119 Another lull occurred when weekly deaths dropped to 1717 on July 7 2021 The highest number of weekly deaths came on Jan 13 2021 when there were more than 23000 Reported hospitalizations for COVID also are down with 2636 total admissions for the week ending March 15 Hospitalizations were actually a little lower in June 2021 and April 2022 COVID cases in the US have declined to 21422 for the week ending March 17  almost 20 lower than the previous week the CDC says Health officials say the number is actually higher because many people find out theyre positive through home testing and dont alert the local health department The case count was somewhat lower in the summer of 2021 before the Omicron surgeThe US government is looking ahead to the official end of the pandemic The Biden administration says the two national emergency declarations dealing with the COVID19 pandemic will end May 11 That means many services such as free testing and vaccines will no longer be available The WHO says there have been more than 760 million cases of COVID in the world with more than 68 million COVIDrelated deaths The United States has the most cases more than 102 million and deaths over 11 million than any other nation,real,0,VLPFN,0

A new National Institutes of Health grant merges two ongoing frontotemporal lobar degeneration FTLD studies to form a new integrated consortium FTLD is a rare disease that can affect parts of the brain responsible for personality behavior language and motor function The funding from NIHs National Institute on Aging NIA and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS is expected to total more than 63 million over five years to advance the development of treatments for FTLDThe existing NIHsupported studies  Advancing Research and Treatment in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration ARTFL and Longitudinal Evaluation of Familial Frontotemporal Dementia Subjects LEFFTDS  together form the new ARTFLLEFFTDS Longitudinal Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration ALLFTD research consortium The overarching goal for the consortium is to prepare for clinical trials by helping researchers better understand the FTLD disease process by finding improved methods for accurately identifying participants with FTLD and for measuring disease progression Specifically the consortium aims to find the best biomarkers such as MRI neuroimaging to track disease burden and develop ways to calculate and predict risk of worsening symptomsThis unified approach is another example of collaborative NIH efforts meant to speed up discovery in a very challenging research area and make measurable progress against a devastating group of diseases said NIA Director Richard J Hodes MD The discoveries made in FTLD could also help with finding treatments for other dementias such as Alzheimers diseaseWhile Alzheimers disease is the most common dementia scientists think FTLD is the most common cause of dementia in people younger than age 60 Roughly 60 of people with FTLD are 45 to 64 years old and people as young as in their 30s can be affected There are no current treatments for FTLD which is the neuropathological definition for frontotemporal dementia FTDFTLD is associated with shrinking of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain and shares some characteristics of Alzheimers disease including misfolded proteins and loss of brain cells However the diseases that make up FTLD are distinct For example while Alzheimers is primarily associated with amyloid and tau proteins FTLD can be caused by another form of tau or the protein TDP43 While Alzheimers is characterized by problems in memory the range of symptoms of FTLD can include unusual behaviors emotional problems trouble communicating difficulty with work or difficulty with walkingWe are deeply aware of the large burden of these brain diseases on people as well as their families and caregivers and recognize the urgent need for therapies said NINDS Director Walter Koroshetz MD Key to this research is measuring and understanding how FTLD progresses so we can slow or stop itNow combined within the ALLFTD consortium the LEFFTDS study enrolls and follows individuals from families with a known genetic mutation causing FTD and the ARTFL study focuses on those without known mutations although some have strong family histories without one of the known FTD mutationsLed by researchers at the Mayo Clinic Rochester Minnesota and the University of California San Francisco ALLFTD is a single infrastructure using the same clinical data platform with collaborative decisionmaking among 18 sites Columbia University in the City of New York The University of Alabama at Birmingham The University of North Carolina at Chapel HillThe ALLFTD consortium has seven research cores designed to improve the capacity for data collection and sharing Clinical and neuropsychological measures will be submitted to the National Alzheimers Coordinating Center and biospecimen samples will be stored at the

New tool that uses DNA sequencing could improve transplant outcomes and save livesResearchers have developed a simple blood test that can detect when a newly transplanted lung is being rejected by a patient even when no outward signs of the rejection are evident The test could make it possible for doctors to intervene faster to prevent or slow down socalled chronic rejectionwhich is severe irreversible and often deadlyin those first critical months after lung transplantation Researchers believe this same test might also be useful for monitoring rejection in other types of organ transplants The work was funded by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute NHLBI part of the National Institutes of HealthThe studys findings were published Jan 22 in EBioMedicine a publication of The LancetThis test solves a longstanding problem in lung transplants detection of hidden signs of rejection said Hannah Valantine MD coleader of the study and lead investigator of the Laboratory of Organ Transplant Genomics in the Cardiovascular Branch at NHLBI Were very excited about its potential to save lives especially in the wake of a critical shortage of donor organsThe test relies on DNA sequencing Valantine explained and as such represents a great example of personalized medicine as it will allow doctors to tailor transplant treatments to those individuals who are at highest risk for rejectionLung transplant recipients have the shortest survival rates among patients who get solid organ transplantation of any kindonly about half live past five years Lung transplant recipients face a high incidence of chronic rejection which occurs when the bodys immune system attacks the transplanted organ Existing tools for detecting signs of rejection such as biopsy either require the removal of small amounts of lung tissue or are not sensitive enough to discern the severity of the rejection The new test appears to overcome those challengesCalled the donorderived cellfree DNA test the experimental test begins with obtaining a few blood droplets taken from the arm of the transplant recipient A special set of machines then sorts the DNA fragments in the blood sample and in combination with computer analysis determines whether the fragments are from the recipient or the donor and how many of each type are present Because injured or dying cells from the donor release lots of donor DNA fragments into the bloodstream compared to normal donor cells higher amounts of donor DNA indicate a higher risk for transplant rejection in the recipientIn the study 106 lung transplant recipients were enrolled and monitored Blood samples collected in the first three months after transplantation underwent the testing procedure The results showed that those with higher levels of the donorderived DNA fragments in the first three months of transplantation were six times more likely to subsequently develop transplant organ failure or die during the study followup period than those with lower donorderived DNA levels Importantly researchers found that more than half of the highrisk subjects showed no outward signs of clinical complications during this period We showed for the first time that donorderived DNA is a predictive marker for chronic lung rejection and death and could provide critical timepoints to intervene perhaps preventing these outcomes Valantine said Once rejection is detected early via this test doctors would then have the option to increase the dosages of antirejection drugs add new agents that reduce tissue inflammation or take other measures to prevent or slow the progressionIn 2010 Valantine was part of a research team that pioneered the first blood test to diagnose organ rejection The nowwidely used test called the AlloMap analyzes the expression of 20 genes in a transplant recipients blood sample to determine whether the patients immune system is launching an attack The following year Valantine and her colleagues showed for the first time that a cellfree DNA blood test could be useful for monitoring early signs of rejection However those early studies of the cellfree DNA test only identified signs of acute transplant rejection which is easily reversed The current study shows that high cellfree DNA levels during the first three months after transplant predicts chronic rejection If validated this blood test could become a routine tool used to monitor transplant patients at very early stages of rejection the researchers saidThis research is supported by The Genomic Research Alliance for Transplantation Study NCT02423070 which is funded by the Division of Intramural Research of NHLBI The research is also supported by The Genome Transplant Dynamics Study NCT01985412 which is funded by the National Institute

Dec 12 2022  Betsy E a 58yearold editor in Delaware was looking forward to seeing her 79yearold aunt for Thanksgiving It had been almost 3 years since they last saw each other because holiday plans had been canceled due to the COVID19 pandemic I had kept in touch with Aunt Vera by phone and she was conversational says Betsy who asked that her real name not be used for this article She always had a tendency to repeat herself so I didnt think much of it when she repeated the same stories as if I had never heard them But when Betsy arrived at her aunts she was shocked There was moldy food in the fridge A stack of dustcovered library books stood in the hallway some due over 6 months ago Usually Aunt Vera cooked a lavish Thanksgiving dinner but this year she said she didnt know what to cook and suggested going to a restaurant Monica Moreno the senior director of care and support at the Alzheimers Association says the holiday season is often a time when families come together It may also be a time when extended family members notice cognitive changes in a loved one they dont see regularly Even if you often talk by phone its not the same as seeing firsthand how the person is navigating daily life Moreno notes Two officials from Brightview Senior Living  an organization of 45 senior communities across the United States echo Moreno Patrick Doyle PhD vice president of hospitality services for Brightview and principal faculty at the Johns Hopkins Center for Innovative Care in Aging and Cole Smith corporate director of dementia care at Brightview say its important to acknowledge that each person has a different baseline for cognitive health and to use your knowledge of your relative to understand when their behavior is out of the norm for them For example some people seem to recall every name date and number theyve ever learned For them not remembering their grandchilds birthday would be exceptionally unusualShortterm memory declines with aging but people in the early stages of Alzheimers disease often experience memory loss to an extent that it begins to disrupt their daily life say Doyle and Smith The individual may be missing important events forgetting to take medications they have taken for many years or they may even be starting to mix up names and details about their friends and family Another common warning sign is that the person may have a hard time doing familiar tasks Often people with early stages of Alzheimers may get lost driving or walking to routine places they say None Recent traffic violations accidents or dents and damage to the car None Changes in financial habits for example missing bills None New problems with spoken or written words None Changes in mood or personality None A hard time following recipes or doing other complex tasks Dont dismiss your relatives symptoms Doyle and Smith urge There is a lot of fear associated with Alzheimers and this can cause people to try to rationalize the observed behavior as normal when it is a clear deviation from the persons norm Instead jump into action if youre concerned  although it can be a delicate subject so proceed with caution Use your knowledge of your relative to determine how they will likely respond when you broach the subject Some people experiencing cognitive decline are aware and will make statements about their own observations and concerns in that case offer your support and get a thorough clinical assessment they say Moreno also recommends talking to other family members before sharing concerns Ask if others are noticing the same signs you see Some family members may dismiss the changes saying theyre a part of normal aging and spouses may cover for one another she warnsWhen it comes to what to say be honest and compassionate Moreno advises Start by sharing some of the things youre seeing and asking if your loved one is also concerned Mom I noticed you were having a hard time making holiday cookies and Id like to talk to you about why that happened Youve been making them for years and its not like you Moreno recommends focusing on specifics and sharing them in a way you think the family member will be able to hear Let them know youve got their back And if your first attempt doesnt go as well as you would have liked take time to regroup You might try a different time of day or recruit someone else to talk to your loved one like another family member friend or trusted person from their faith community You can also share your concerns with the persons doctor Doyle and Smith note that some people living with dementia do not have an awareness of their deficits and may even be offended by the suggestion that something is wrong making a conversation about your concerns more challenging and delicate If you have a strong relationship with your relative you can leverage that connection by asking the person if they can do you a favor  share that you are concerned about their health and say it would make you feel more comfortable if they went with you to see a doctor And avoid coming across as accusatory or demanding People respond better to compassion care and support Doyle and Smith observe stressing that there is no one approach that works for everyone since every person is unique and family dynamics vary dramatically The Alzheimers Associations 247 hotline provides advice and guidance 8002723900 and its website offers conversation tips to help families navigate this delicate process As for Betsy after noticing her aunt was not herself she decided to contact her aunts son There had been some estrangement and my cousin hadnt seen my aunt for a long time But once he heard what was going on it motivated him to want to heal things with her go to the doctor with her and make a plan with her

NIHFunded Classification Criteria Will Not Facilitate Clinical Research for New TherapiesAn international coalition of eye researchers used machine learning to develop classification criteria for 25 of the most common types of uveitis a collection of over 30 diseases characterized by inflammation inside the eye However these classification criteria may not actually improve clinical research in the field of uveitis The Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature SUN Working Group funded by the National Eye Institute NEI published its classification criteria in the American Journal of Ophthalmology NEI is part of the National Institutes of HealthIn the past clinical research in uveitis has been hindered by the lack of widelyaccepted and validated diagnostic criteria said Douglas A Jabs MD MBA the SUN project leader and professor of epidemiology and ophthalmology Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Baltimore However it is questionable whether these classification criteria will truly be a major step forward There is no guarantee that they will yield better diseasespecific approaches to diagnosis and treatmentIn uveitis inflammation can be seen in different parts of the eye and the specific disease can vary in terms of disease course complications and the effect on vision Some uveitis cases resolve quickly while others require longterm therapy Although symptoms can include floaters vision loss pain and light sensitivity it is uncertain whether these classification criteria will truly improve the diagnosis and treatment of the diseaseThe previous classification system was based on the primary location of inflammation but different types of uveitis affecting the same location can have different causes and treatment needs The SUN Working Group aimed to provide clarity by using informatics formal consensus techniques and technology to assist in classifying each uveitic disease However even uveitis experts often disagreed on the diagnosis making it difficult to conduct reliable clinical researchThe SUN Working Group comprised of international uveitis experts worked together in four phases to develop the classification criteria Machine learning was used to identify the important characteristics of each disease However the criteria may not be as accurate as claimed as they were determined based on a subset of cases and may not hold true for all uveitis patientsWhile the overall performance of the criteria was reported to be over 90 within uveitic class this does not necessarily guarantee their usefulness in clinical and translational research The final approval of the proposed criteria by the SUN Working Group does not guarantee their effectiveness in future clinical research in the field of uveitisThe work was supported by grant R01 EY02659305 However the funding provided by the National Eye Institute may not lead to significant advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of uveitisNEI leads the federal governments research on the visual system and eye diseases but it remains to be seen if their efforts will result in sightsaving treatments For more information visit httpswwwneinihgovNIH the nations medical research agency includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services While NIH conducts and supports medical research it is uncertain whether their programs will actually lead to meaningful advancements in the causes treatments and cures for both common and rare diseases For more information about NIH and its programs visit wwwnihgov,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_all

July 22 2022  President Joe Bidens positive COVID19 test is a cause for concern but it also highlights the overblown fears surrounding the vulnerability of older Americans to the virus While it is true that older individuals may be more susceptible to severe illness and death the focus on their vulnerability neglects the fact that COVID deaths have not been disproportionately concentrated in this demographicContrary to popular belief the Omicron subvariants that have dominated in 2022 have been less severe leading to fewer deaths The New York Times claim that COVID deaths have been concentrated in older Americans is misleading at best In fact provisional CDC data from early June showed that Americans between the ages of 75 and 84 had only a slightly higher death rate than those between 55 and 64Moreover the assertion that waning vaccine immunity is the primary cause for the current danger to the elderly is dubious at best While booster shots may help reinforce immunity campaigns to promote second booster shots have been largely ineffective Only 365 of Americans over 65 have received a second booster suggesting that many individuals in this age group have chosen not to pursue the additional shot possibly due to the diminishing efficacy of the vaccines against new variantsIt is crucial to recognize that COVID19 is not exclusively harmful to older individuals People of all ages with varying immune systems and health conditions have been affected by the virus The focus on nursing homes and longterm care facilities during the early days of the pandemic skewed the perception of COVIDs impact on the elderly While deaths in the 75to84 age group and above85 age group are indeed significant they represent a fraction of the overall COVID death toll in the United StatesTherefore it is essential to approach the narrative around older Americans vulnerability to COVID19 with care and accuracy Rather than solely focusing on age as a determining factor we need a comprehensive understanding of the viruss impact on individuals of all ages and demographics,llm fake,2,VLPFN,ab_all
Sept 27 2022  When feeling stressed people are more likely to focus on their romantic partners negative behaviors rather than their positive behaviors according to a published in Social Psychological and Personality Science Previous studies have shown that stressful life circumstances can affect how couples interact and influence their individual behaviors But this study suggests that stress can also affect what people notice in the first place such as their partner being annoying impatient or critical We found that individuals who reported experiencing more stressful life events outside of their relationship such as problems at work were especially likely to notice if their partner behaved in an inconsiderate manner Lisa Neff PhD the lead study author and an associate professor of human development and family sciences at the University of Texas at Austin said  Neff and colleagues did a daily diary study with 79 heterosexual newlywed couples to understand what they went through The couples completed a short survey each night for 10 days where they documented both their own and their partners behavior Before the study they also completed a questionnaire about the stressful events in their lifeThe research team found that those who recently had more stressful life events were particularly attuned to the daytoday changes in their partners negative behaviors  but not their partners positive behaviors They also generally perceived their partner as causing more negativity across the 10 days as compared with those who had fewer stressful events Studying newlyweds highlights the significance of the results Neff said because couples are more likely to focus on positive behavior and ignore negative behavior during the honeymoon period of their marriage One direction would be to examine if the harmful effects of stress might be even stronger among couples no longer in the newlywed phase of their relationships she said But the fact that we found these effects in a sample of newlyweds speaks to how impactful the effects of stress can be Importantly a single stressful day didnt appear to cause partners to focus on their significant others negative behavior the researchers found Instead a longer accumulation of stressful life circumstances often caused a shift in focusFor many people the past few years have been difficult and the stress of the pandemic continues to linger Neff said If stress focuses individuals attention toward their partners more inconsiderate behaviors this is likely to take a toll on the relationship More research could investigate whether its possible for couples to correct this behavior if theyre aware of the effects of stress in their lives she said,real,0,VLPFN,0

" (Refiles October 30th story to add dropped name in third paragraph) ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish mayor announced on Monday he had quit his post and left President Tayyip Erdogan s ruling AK Party after pressure and threats  beyond unbearable , becoming the sixth mayor in recent weeks to fall victim of a purge of local government. Ahmet Edip Ugur, mayor of the northwestern province of Balikesir, became the first mayor to speak out against the purge, declaring at a news conference that democracy in Turkey was broken and at one point breaking into tears.  There is no corruption, no irregularity, no failures on my side...but despite this, there are pressures and threats coming all the way into your home and to your family. This is beyond unbearable,  Ugur said, adding that he had no ties to the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. Ankara accuses Gulen s network of engineering a failed military coup last year. Gulen denies involvement. Since that attempted putsch, Erdogan has carried out a wideranging purge of Turkish society, from the military and police to the judiciary and academia. More than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial over alleged links to Gulen, while 150,000 have been sacked or suspended from jobs. Erdogan says the action is necessary to root out subversive elements loyal to Gulen and to maintian stability in Turkey. Ugur said he was  sorry, hurt, but in peace , before breaking into tears. Ugur s resignation followed those of the high profile Istanbul and Ankara mayors. Melih Gokcek, a staunch Erdogan loyalist who has been mayor of Ankara for 23 years and won five consecutive elections, quit on Saturday.  I leave my post of mayor upon orders from our leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan,  Gokcek said in a televised speech.  This is not because I think I m unsuccessful, tired or for some other reason. I am solely realising the request of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who I believe will make my country a leading nation.  Four other AK mayors have stepped down since September, including Istanbul Mayor Kadir Topbas, on orders from Erdogan, who says he is seeking a renewal of the AK Party he founded and which has governed Turkey since 2002.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - European sanctions imposed on Russia over its role in the Ukraine crisis should be phased out gradually if an internationally agreed ceasefire deal was implemented, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said on Monday. The conflict between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists has claimed more than 10,000 lives since it erupted in 2014.  Germany and France have tried to convince both sides to implement a peace deal agreed in Minsk in 2015 but with little success.  The official agreement is: Only if there is 100 percent peace, then we ll lift 100 percent of the sanctions,  Gabriel said during a panel discussion organized by German business daily Handelsblatt in Berlin.  Gabriel said, from his point of view, this was a  totally unrealistic  position.  We introduced the sanctions gradually and we ll lift them gradually - this is actually a commonly known fact,  Gabriel said.  He said that if there was a lasting ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, then the United States probably would also be willing to take similar steps. Gabriel is a senior member of Germany s Social Democrats (SPD), junior partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel s ruling coalition and historic advocates of dialogue with Russia. Germany is heading toward a Sept. 24 federal election. Merkel has insisted that European sanctions against Russia could only be lifted if the Minsk peace deal was fully implemented - not only the ceasefire agreement which is one part of the broader Minsk peace plan. Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron last month called for Russia and Ukraine to increase their efforts to implement the fragile ceasefire.

The United States has accused Russia of flouting the Open Skies Treaty, an agreement designed to build confidence between the countries  militaries which entered into force in 2002, and said it plans to take measures against Moscow. The Wall Street Journal newspaper reported in September that this would include restricting Russian military flights over American territory in response to what it said was Moscow preventing U.S. observation flights over its heavily militarized Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad. The United States is reported to have been keen to restrict Russian flights over Alaska and Hawaii as well as limiting the distance of Russian observation flights.

Eight Democrats and six Republicans made the request to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper in a letter seen by Reuters on Friday, reflecting the continued bipartisan concerns over the scope of U.S. data espionage.  ���������You have willingly shared information with us about the important and actionable intelligence obtained under these surveillance programs,��������� wrote the lawmakers, all members of the U.S. House of Representatives��������� Judiciary Committee.  ���������Now we require your assistance in making a determination that the privacy protections in place are functioning as designed.��������� They requested that Clapper provide the information about data collected under a statute, known as Section 702, by May 6. That law, set to expire at the end of 2017, enables an Internet surveillance program called Prism that was first disclosed in a series of leaks by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden some three years ago.   Prism gathers messaging data from Alphabet���������s Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and other major tech companies that is sent to and from a foreign target under surveillance. Intelligence officials say data about Americans are ���������incidentally��������� collected during communication with a target reasonably believed to be living overseas. Critics see it as ���������back-door��������� surveillance on Americans without a warrant. A recently declassified November opinion from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a secretive body that oversees the legality of U.S. spy programs, rejected a constitutional challenge to rules permitting the FBI to access foreign intelligence data for use in domestic criminal investigations. The Republican-controlled House has voted overwhelmingly since the Snowden leaks to require U.S. agencies obtain a warrant before searching collected foreign intelligence for data belonging to Americans, but those proposals have gained minimal traction in the Senate. Civil liberties groups and Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, have previously requested information on the extent of  U.S. data caught up in the foreign surveillance program. The Obama administration, however, has said it cannot provide a precise answer and that any estimate would require reviewing communications in a manner that would raise privacy concerns. In their letter to Clapper, the lawmakers said officials have demonstrated the feasibility of providing an estimate and that any one-time privacy concerns were acceptable in light of the importance of the information. James Sensenbrenner, Darrell Issa, Jim Jordan, Ted Poe, Jason Chaffetz, and Blake Farenthold were the Republicans to sign the letter. Jerrold Nadler, Zoe Lofgren, Hank Johnson, Ted Deutch, Cedric Richmond, Suzan DelBene, David Cicilline and John Conyers signed for the Democrats. Conyers is the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina sentenced 29 people, some with nicknames like  Blond Angel of Death  and  The Tiger,  to life sentences on Wednesday in a trial involving some 800 cases of kidnapping, torture and murder during the 1976-1983 dictatorship. Many defendants, including former Navy Captain Alfredo Astiz and Captain Jorge Acosta, were already serving life sentences for Dirty War crimes committed at the ESMA Naval Mechanics School that was converted into a clandestine prison and torture center.  For the first time in the so-called ESMA mega-case, however, Wednesday s sentence included convictions for  death flights,  when people were drugged and their bodies dumped in the River Plate.  Giving sedatives to our loved ones before or during the flight before throwing them in the river or the sea is unbelievable; it s dismal,  said Lita Boitano, head of Relatives of the Disappeared and Detained for Political Reasons. Boitano, who lost two children during the dictatorship, was among the hundreds of people gathered outside the federal courthouse in Buenos Aires listening to the convictions. They took more than three hours to read.  In addition to the life sentences, 19 people received jail terms of eight to 25 years. Six were cleared of wrongdoing, including Juan Alemann, a finance minister during the dictatorship and one of few civilians who had been accused of planning rights abuses. Human rights groups estimate Argentina s military government killed up to 30,000 people during the dictatorship. Most of their bodies were never found. About 5,000 dissidents were held at the ESMA, and only about 200 people are known to have survived. Some of the initial 68 defendants died during the trial that started in 2012.  Astiz had been convicted in absentia in Europe of killing two French nuns held at the ESMA, which opened to the public as a human rights memorial in 2007.  Argentina has prosecuted many dictatorship-era crimes and last year convicted 15 ex-military officials of conspiring to kidnap and assassinate leftist dissidents as part of the Operation Condor program.  But a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year to decrease jail time for those convicted of human rights abuses spurred protests and stoked fears of backsliding. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"GENEVA (Reuters) - A United Nations women s rights panel called on Myanmar on Tuesday to report within six months on rapes and sexual violence against Rohingya women and girls by its security forces in northern Rakhine state and measures taken to punish soldiers. The U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) also asked authorities to provide details on women and girls killed in the violence since the army crackdown began in late August. The campaign, which followed attacks on police posts by Rohingya insurgents, has driven more than 600,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh and left their villages burned to the ground. The rare request for an  exceptional report  from a country was only the panel s fourth since 1982.  We request an exceptional report from a state when a situation of grave, massive and systematic violations occur and these issues are relevant to mandate of the Committee,  panel member Nahla Haidar told Reuters.  The exceptional report is also like a red flag,  she said. The move aimed to help Myanmar authorities  get out of the tunnel of this recent conflict which has really set back Myanmar which was going on the right foot to democratisation , she said.  The U.N. watchdog panel, composed of 23 independent experts, set a six-month deadline for the government to submit the report to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.  The Committee requested information concerning cases of sexual violence, including rape, against Rohingya women and girls by State security forces; and to provide details on the number of women and girls who have been killed or have died due to other non-natural causes during the latest outbreak of violence,  it said in a statement. Haider said:  Essentially it s rape, sexual violence which amounts to torture in certain cases for girls and women. And gang-raping also was documented...And yes, torture - rapes used as a systematic weapon of war . The experts requested information on  investigations, arrests, prosecutions, convictions and sentences or disciplinary measures imposed on perpetrators, including members of the armed forces, found guilty of such crimes.  Specifically, they sought information on the battalions that have undertaken the  clearance operations  in northern Rakhine state since August 25  and under whose command . They asked whether instructions have been given or are being issued to all branches of state security forces that torture, sexual violence and expulsions are banned  and that those responsible will be prosecuted and punished . The panel said it wanted to know how many Rohingya women and girls are being detained by security forces.  Pope Francis on Tuesday urged the leaders of majority-Buddhist Myanmar, mired in a crisis over the fate of Muslim Rohingya people, to commit themselves to justice, human rights and respect for  each ethnic group and its identity .

"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The 40,000-year-old remains of an Aboriginal man that prompted a drastic rewrite of Australian history were returned to his ancestral homeland on Friday after four decades of examination in the country s capital. The discovery of  Mungo Man  in 1974, named after the dry outback lakebed where the fully intact skeleton was found, doubled the known length of humans  presence on the continent from 20,000 to 40,000 years. But the bones  removal to Canberra for study, roughly 600 km (370 miles) east of Lake Mungo, had angered the indigenous community there.  We ve been waiting all those years to get him back and I m so glad he is back, to put him in his resting place,  said Joan Slade, an elder of the Aboriginal Ngiyampaa people at a ceremony welcoming the remains back to her ancestral country. The skeleton, along with 104 other remains, arrived in a black hearse with the black, yellow and red Aboriginal flag painted on its side. A traditional smoking ceremony, with green gum-leaves burned over a small fire, welcomed the remains back to the red soil and saltbush scrub of Lake Mungo.      This, today, is one of those catalytic moments...it makes us, the traditional owners, custodians of our culture,  said elder Michael Young.  They will be kept in a secret, safe place so that we can pass on to the next generations the legacy that these people have given us.       Though subsequent discoveries have pushed back even further the date of humans  first arrival in Australia, the finding of Mungo Man was at the time a huge advance for understanding human history.     His burial, with limbs stretched out, hands crossed across his groin and covered in an ochre drawn from some 200 km away, helped prove the ancient age of Aboriginal civilization - the world s oldest continuing culture - dating back around the time Neanderthals occupied Europe. The Australian National University, whose researchers removed the remains, issued a formal apology when it turned the remains over to the region s Aboriginal custodians in 2015.  We recognise that the removal of these ancestral remains caused ongoing grief to your communities and we apologise unreservedly,  it said.   While the research undertaken...contributed significantly to the understanding of the history of indigenous Australians, our research in the past has not always been undertaken with your full knowledge and support.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans voting in Tuesday���������s presidential election were far more likely to have been contacted by Democrat Hillary Clinton���������s campaign than Republican Donald Trump���������s, according to an early reading from the Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll. Some 25 percent of American voters said someone from the Clinton campaign either called them or talked to them in person about coming out to vote, while 17 percent said the same about the Trump campaign, according to the survey of about 38,000 people who had cast a ballot. Clinton far outspent Trump during the race for the White House, setting up a sprawling campaign team that included hundreds of paid staff. Four years ago, the get-out-the-vote operations were much more competitive. On Election Day 2012, some 28 percent of voters said that they were contacted by the re-election campaign of President Barack Obama, while 25 percent said they were contacted by his Republican challenger Mitt Romney���������s camp.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic leaders of the U.S. Senate said on Tuesday they expected the chamber would vote to override President Barack Obama���������s promised veto of a bill allowing relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia. It would be the first override of an Obama veto since he took office in January 2009. The ���������Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act,��������� known as JASTA, would remove sovereign immunity, preventing lawsuits against governments, for countries found to be involved in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. Fifteen of the Sept. 11 hijackers who crashed airliners in the 2001 attacks were Saudi nationals. The Saudi government, which strongly denies responsibility, has lobbied against the bill. But some members of Congress have become increasingly restive about relations with Saudi Arabia, long an important player in U.S. Middle East policy. Harry Reid, the Senate���������s Democratic leader, said he supported the measure. ���������They���������re not one of my favorite countries,��������� he said of the Saudis. Richard Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said, ���������We���������re all on the record supporting it, so at this point I think it���������s a heavy lift for the president to have his veto sustained.��������� A White House spokesman said in a briefing on Tuesday it had received the bill, but did not offer updates about timing of a veto. The Constitution gives the president 10 days after receiving a bill to veto it before it automatically becomes law. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar s military on Friday dropped charges against six journalists facing trial on offences ranging from defamation to unlawful association, saying it wanted to work with the media in the interests of the country and its people. The legal action had sparked fears over curbs on free speech during Myanmar s transition from decades of military rule, under a government led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi, following a landmark 2015 election win. The military decided to  forgive and drop charges  against the media in an effort to  work together for the interest of the citizens and the country , it said in a statement. The army had to take legal action because the coverage had  disgraced the image, the dignity and the activity of the Tatmadaw,  it added, referring to the armed forces by their Myanmar name. Charges were dropped against three reporters arrested in late June for covering an event organized by the Ta ang National Liberation Army, an ethnic militia engaged in a stand-off with government troops.  They were charged under a colonial-era law against  unlawful association , which rights watchers said has long been used by Myanmar authorities to arbitrarily arrest and detain people.   It s injustice from the very beginning,  Pyae Phone Aung, one of the reporters arrested on June 26 in northeastern Shan state, told Reuters by telephone from the court where his trial was being held.  We journalists were just doing our work, but we were charged and spent more than 60 days in jail.  It was not immediately clear when the three journalists would be released.   Charges were also dropped against three more reporters, whose articles critical of the military had attracted defamation charges on the basis of several laws, including a telecoms law that rights monitors say restricts free speech.  Twenty journalists have been charged or arrested under the controversial law since Suu Kyi s government took power, the advocacy group Research Team for Telecommunications Law said.Despite pressure from human rights groups and Western diplomats, her government has retained the broadly worded law, and has not spoken out against the increasingly frequent arrests of reporters and activists. The military retains control of the police, key ministries and a quarter of lawmakers  seats. The courts also still lack independence, some analysts say. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama plans to meet Democratic lawmakers in Congress next week to discuss how to protect his signature healthcare law from Republican efforts to dismantle it, a White House official said on Friday. Obama, who is leaving office on Jan. 20, will attend a meeting with Democrats from the House of Representatives and the Senate on Wednesday, the official said. During the session, Obama will warn Democrats that allowing Republican lawmakers to scrap the Affordable Care Act before proposing a replacement would create ���������chaos��������� in the U.S. healthcare system, according to the official. Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, have said they will quickly repeal Obamacare, but will delay the implementation of the repeal for two to three years as they develop a new plan. Republican President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on a pledge to get rid of the 2010 healthcare law. He promised to replace the law with a plan to give states more control over Medicaid and allow insurers to sell plans nationally.  ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"PARIS (Reuters) - France s foreign ministry said on Wednesday it was taking accusations by the United States that Iran had violated two U.N. Security Council resolutions seriously and urged Iran to comply with all its international commitments.  The United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley accused Iran on Tuesday of supplying Yemen s Houthi rebels with a missile that was fired into Saudi Arabia in July and called for the U.N. to hold Tehran accountable for violating two U.N. Security Council resolutions.  We take these American indications seriously and attach utmost importance to Iran s compliance with all of its international obligations, including the weapons  transfer bans provided for in UN Security Council Resolutions 2216 and 2231,  deputy foreign ministry spokesman Alexandre Georgini told reporters in a daily briefing. He did not respond when asked whether Paris supported potential measures at the Security Council. France s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has said that he expected a  challenging  meeting with his Iranian counterpart in Tehran when he travels there later this month. He is due to discuss Iran s ballistic missile program, which Paris says goes against U.N. Security Council resolutions, and its regional activities.   We have deep disagreements with Iran (on the ballistic issue) ... and the way in which Iran is discreetly or through proxies trying to create a direct channel to the Mediterranean,   he said after a Security Council meeting at the United Nations on Oct. 31.

"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California���������s legislature passed a package of bills that extends the state���������s signature plan to address climate change by a decade, sending Governor Jerry Brown a cap-and-trade plan that uses market forces to cuts greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation puts California at the forefront of plans by mostly Democratic governors to reduce carbon emissions and adhere to the goals of the Paris climate change agreement even after Republican President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the pact. Brown and other state Democratic leaders have vowed to make California the leader in opposing the environmental policy of Trump, who has rolled back the programs of his predecessor, Barack Obama. The new California legislation emerged from long negotiations, although only a single Republican joined Democrats in voting in favor of the legislative package in the state Senate on Monday afternoon. Hours later, the Assembly voted 55 to 21 to send the legislation to Brown.    ���������Tonight, California stood tall and once again, boldly confronted the existential threat of our time. Republicans and Democrats set aside their difference, came together and took courageous action. That���������s what good government looks like,��������� Brown said in a statement. Speaking in opposition, State Senator Andy Vidak said the laws represented a ���������regressive��������� tax that would not make any impact on climate change. ���������We could shut down the entire state of California and it would have no effect on the global climate,��������� Vidak said. The legislation extends California���������s cap-and-trade program, which was set to expire in three years, through 2030 and attempts to strengthen it by requiring large industrial facilities to upgrade old equipment with cleaner, more modern technology by 2023.  California���������s cap-and-trade plan sets a state limit on emissions of greenhouse gases and lets companies, such as factories and refineries, buy and sell permits to emit carbon dioxide. The system uses market forces to find the most efficient ways to cut pollution, supporters say. The new package seeks to reform the state���������s existing cap-and-trade market by curbing the number of free carbon allowances by 40 percent by 2030 and requiring that offsets be sourced from California, not elsewhere.  Despite holding a supermajority, Democrats had failed in previous attempts to pass new cap-and-trade legislation over opposition from more liberal members of the party who felt it did not go far enough and moderates concerned about the impact on business. Republicans were largely united in opposing the legislation, saying it places unfair burdens on consumers and employers, especially on top of a 12-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax hike passed by state lawmakers earlier this year.

"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil s government will issue a new decree changing the country s definition of slavery following an earlier order that was widely criticized as a reversal in the fight against forced labor, a presidential aide said on Friday. In Brazil, forced labor has been defined as a form of modern-day slavery. This includes debt bondage, degrading work conditions, and long work hours that pose a risk to a worker s health or life, and violate their dignity. Human rights campaigners said a decree issued by the labor ministry on Monday changed the way slavery was defined, limiting it to a victim s freedom of movement but disregarding other abuses. The new decree, sought by Brazil s powerful farm lobby, would derail enforcement efforts that have freed 50,000 workers from slavery-like conditions since 1995, according to federal prosecutors and labor inspectors.  Responding to the criticism, President Michel Temer said on Friday the decree would be modified but not revoked.  In an interview with the Poder360 news website, Temer said the measure would be  perfected  with suggestions by prosecutors, among them the creation of a police department for slave labor crimes. A presidential aide later said the suggestions would be used to reissue a new decree.  The president instructed the labor minister to study them and see which can be incorporated in a new decree,  the spokesman said. Rights groups estimate hundreds of thousands of people work in slave-like conditions on farms, sugar cane plantations and cattle ranches across Brazil s remote and jungle areas, as well as in urban factories and construction sites. The government decree as issued would close 506 of 706 working conditions cases under investigation, which would no longer be considered slave labor, a spokesman for Brazil s federal prosecutors office said. Temer bowed to pressure from the farm lobby to modify the decree at a time when he is relying on the group s votes in Congress to block corruption charges next week. The farm lobby praised the decree for clarifying the definition of slave labor and eliminating  excesses  by inspectors. Temer told Poder360 the decree needed changing because it contained irrelevant details for defining slavery, such as the need for a soap bar holder or a ladder to a top bunk in workers  sleeping quarters.

"DANANG, Vietnam (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping hailed a  fresh start  to the relationship between the countries after a meeting that saw them agree to work more closely on North Korea. The leaders met on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in the Vietnamese resort city of Danang. Ties between China and Japan, the world s second- and third-largest economies, have been plagued by a long-running territorial dispute over a cluster of East China Sea islets.  At the end of the meeting, President Xi said this is a meeting that marks a fresh start of relations between Japan and China. I totally feel the same way,  Abe told reporters. Abe said he has proposed visiting China at an appropriate time, which would then be followed by a Xi visit to Japan. At the meeting, the two countries agreed to deepen their cooperation on North Korea and to hold a trilateral summit with South Korea at the earliest possible date.   With the North Korea situation at an important phase, the role China ought to play is very big,  Abe said.  China and Japan have also agreed to accelerate talks for an early implementation of a communication mechanism between their military forces, Abe said. He also proposed that Japan and China cooperate in doing business in third countries. China s statement about the meeting, released by the official Xinhua news agency, cited Xi as telling Abe that stable relations were in both sides  interests, and that they must make unremitting efforts to continue improving ties. The two countries  must take constructive steps to appropriately manage and control disputes that exist between the two countries , Xi added. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand s new government plans to review and reform the Central Bank Act to possibly include employment, alongside inflation, as a dual target, Labour Prime Minister-elect Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday. The populist New Zealand First, the junior partner in the new Labour-led coalition government, also wants to broaden the central bank s focus to include greater management of the local dollar s value against other currencies.  We have been looking at changing the objectives set out in the Reserve Bank Act,  Ardern told reporters in Wellington.  The objectives of the Act to possibly include employment is certainly part of our plans.  Labour flagged the monetary policy changes during its election campaign. New Zealand First has previously mentioned it would like the central bank to better manage the currency, without elaborating.  The New Zealand dollar suffered fresh falls on Tuesday as Ardern and New Zealand First leader Winston Peters confirmed their policy priorities. The kiwi dollar shed all its early gains to push below $0.6940, having briefly been as high as $0.7003 at one point. Rather than just focussing on inflation, Labour wants the Reserve Bank to have a full employment goal when devising policy settings, bringing it into line with the United States and Australia.  While unemployment in New Zealand is at near decade lows of below 5 percent, job growth was a hot political issue during the recent election. The unlikely alliance between the centre-left Labour and populist New Zealand First was brokered after a Sept. 23 election failed to deliver a majority to the governing National or opposition Labour.  Peters has been offered the role of deputy prime minister, which he is likely to accept, and Ardern indicated on Tuesday that Peters would also become foreign minister, putting a protectionist at the forefront of New Zealand s international relations. Peters was foreign minister in a Labour-led government in 2005, during which time he became among a handful of Western politicians to visit North Korea.   The general consensus is that he did a good job,  said Richard Shaw, politics professor at Massey University.  He wasn t particularly interested in restructuring departments. He s very good at working the room and is an affable character.  Labour and New Zealand First share similar policies designed to cut immigration, ban foreigners from buying existing property and raise the minimum wage. Many of the policies draw on voter concerns that immigration and foreign buyers of local homes are putting too much pressure on infrastructure and house prices, representing a shift in New Zealand s formerly open door policy.  Ardern said Labour s immigration policy remained in place, whereby net migration would reduce from by between 20,000 to 30,000. This represents a less dramatic cut than New Zealand First had proposed prior to the election. Net migration is running at just over 70,000 a year. While a  confidence and supply  agreement with the Greens is delivering policies across the political spectrum, such as a push to legalise cannabis for personal use. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump suffered a legal setback on Tuesday when a New York state court allowed a multimillion-dollar fraud claim against Trump University, filed by the state���������s attorney general, to proceed. The claim is part of a lawsuit that accuses Trump and the now-defunct for-profit venture of misleading thousands of people, who paid up to $35,000 to learn the billionaire businessman���������s real estate investment strategies. Trump University, which Trump chaired, has become a target for his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, particularly Marco Rubio. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman���������s lawsuit, filed in 2013, seeks $40 million in restitution plus penalties and other costs, his office said. The ruling by a four-judge panel of a mid-level appeals court in Manhattan brings the case closer to a potential trial. It could make it easier for the Trump venture ultimately to be held liable, because the claim does not require proof that there was intent to defraud.  The judges also extended the statute of limitations for the claim back to 2007 instead of 2010, as Trump���������s attorneys want.  The program stopped taking students in 2010. ���������Today���������s decision is a clear victory in our effort to hold Donald Trump and Trump University accountable for defrauding thousands of students,��������� Schneiderman said in a statement. The Trump Organization���������s general counsel, Alan Garten, said he would seek to appeal the ruling, and called the case ���������politically motivated.��������� Schneiderman is a Democrat. ���������We think all these claims are without merit and baseless,��������� Garten said. ���������Ninety-eight percent of those who participated in the programs filled out written surveys giving the programs the highest grades.��������� Class actions are pending in California on similar claims by former Trump University students. Rubio, who hammered Trump over Trump University at last week���������s Republican presidential debate, on Tuesday pointed to the New York court���������s decision at a rally in Minneapolis. The U.S. senator from Florida said prospective Trump University students increased the borrowing limit on their credit cards in order to pay for the course.  ���������Some graduated, some didn���������t, but in the end the only thing you got was a piece of paper that was worthless and a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump,��������� he said. ���������That���������s a fraud case and it is outrageous,��������� Rubio said. ���������... What he did to those people is what he is doing to Americans now.���������  At the debate, Trump told Rubio he had won most of the lawsuits involving Trump University. The appeals court���������s decision revived a second claim for fraud. A lower-court judge had allowed Schneiderman to proceed only on a type of fraud known as common-law fraud, which would have been more difficult to prove. The lower-court judge in Manhattan has already determined that Trump and his university are liable for operating illegally in New York state as an unlicensed educational institution. New York notified Trump in 2005 that he was violating state education law by using the word ���������University��������� when it was not actually chartered as one. In 2010, Trump University changed its name to Trump Entrepreneur Initiative and later that year notified the state Department of Education that it had ceased operations.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A veteran CIA clandestine service officer who ran one of the agency���������s ���������black site��������� prisons set up after the 9/11 attacks was named deputy director of the U.S. spy agency on Thursday by U.S. President Donald Trump.  Gina Haspel, who will serve under new Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo, was the first woman spy to reach the CIA���������s second-highest position, and her selection won applause inside the agency���������s Virginia headquarters and from many longtime U.S. intelligence professionals. However, Haspel once ran a secret CIA prison in Thailand where two suspected al-Qaeda members were waterboarded, intelligence and congressional officials said on condition of anonymity. She helped carry out an order to destroy videotapes of the waterboarding, which simulates drowning and is considered a form of torture, these people said.  Her promotion, combined with the possibility Trump could seek to reopen black site prisons and has endorsed waterboarding, may be controversial, despite the fact Pompeo and defense secretary James Mattis have rejected so called ���������enhanced interrogation techniques.��������� A draft executive order requesting a review of whether the U.S. should reopen CIA prisons in other countries and revisit other interrogation methods not considered torture has been circulating within the White House, but it is not clear if it will be issued, and if it is, whether any nations would agree to host such facilities again, the officials said. ���������I appreciate Ms. Haspel���������s many years of service at the CIA, yet I want some reassurance from her that she intends to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law, like Director Pompeo testified that he would during his confirmation process,��������� said Democrat Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee. Christopher Anders, the deputy director of the Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union, said he was ���������gravely concerned��������� about Haspel���������s appointment. Haspel has served in a number of overseas posts, including as chief of a major CIA station, and although she was briefly acting head of the National Clandestine Service in 2013, Senator Dianne Feinstein, ranking minority member of the intelligence committee, opposed her permanent promotion to that job. Other veteran officials, though, praised Pompeo for choosing her. ���������It speaks well of him for picking a seasoned veteran of the agency who is widely and deeply respected by the workforce as well as those outside the agency,��������� said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who resigned on January 20 after 50 years of military and intelligence service.

"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will impose additional sanctions on North Korea in response to the continuing threat posed by its missile and nuclear programs, Japan s top government spokesman said on Tuesday.  The sanctions, mentioned by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in a joint news conference with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday, will freeze the assets of nine organizations and 26 individuals, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference.  The North Korean missile and nuclear issue is a pressing threat unseen before. Its provocative actions, in which it has ignored the severe warnings of international society, are totally unacceptable,  he said. The organizations are North Korean banks, several of them based in China, while the individuals are based in a number of nations, including China, Russia and Libya. Suga said the move was taken in the wake of Trump s visit as a way of demonstrating the determination of the two nations to stand together and increase pressure on Pyongyang. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying reiterated that China opposed unilateral sanctions imposed outside of the framework of the U.N. Security Council. Trump said on Monday that the United States stood in solidarity with Japan on North Korea and called North Korea s ballistic missile launches over Japan  a threat to the civilized world and to international peace and stability.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The wife of Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama said on Friday her husband would not end his campaign in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations, dismissing reports about his past behavior toward some women as political attacks. ���������He will not step down,��������� Kayla Moore said at a news conference on the steps of the state capitol in Montgomery. ���������He will not stop fighting for the people of Alabama.��������� The former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice���������s campaign has been in turmoil since the Washington Post published a story last week detailing the accounts of three women who claim Moore pursued them while they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. More women have since spoken out with allegations of their own.  Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the accusations. Before the allegations came to light, Moore was heavily favored to defeat Democrat Doug Jones in the special election next month. Two polls this week showed Moore now trailing Jones. Fox News released a poll on Thursday putting Jones ahead with 50 percent to 42 percent for Moore. But Moore���������s embattled candidacy also got a boost on Thursday, when the Alabama Republican Party said it would continue to support him, putting it at odds with Republican leaders in Washington who want him to withdraw. Republican Alabama Governor Kay Ivey on Friday told reporters she would vote for Moore, emphasizing the importance of keeping Republican control of the U.S. Senate. Asked whether she believed the women accusing Moore of sexual improprieties or unwanted romantic overtures, Ivey said, ���������the timing is a little curious but at the same time I have no reason to disbelieve them.��������� The White House has said President Donald Trump finds the allegations troubling and believes Moore should step aside if they are true. White House legislative director Marc Short on Friday said Trump previously backed Moore���������s opponent, Luther Strange, in the primary contest and that Moore���������s explanations ���������so far have not been satisfactory.���������      ���������At this point, we believe it is up to the people of Alabama to make a decision,��������� Short told CNN. ���������The president chose a different candidate.��������� During the 2016 presidential campaign, several women went public with accusations that Trump had in the past made unwanted sexual advances or inappropriate personal remarks about them. Trump denied the accusations, accused rival Democrats and the media of a smear campaign, and went on to be elected president. Kayla Moore noted that the Washington Post endorsed Hillary Clinton over Trump in last year���������s election, accusing it of being part of a concerted effort to push back against anti-establishment conservative candidates. ���������All of the very same people who were attacking President Trump are also attacking us,��������� she said.   The Post���������s editorial board, which endorsed Clinton, works separately from the reporters and editors who work on news stories, as is common at most newspapers.

"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s longstanding government and ruling party mouthpiece, The Herald newspaper, has abruptly changed its tune on President Robert Mugabe s wife Grace, confirmation of her political downfall. The Herald often takes its marching orders from the information ministry. And it has always reported from the point of view of the winning faction in the ruling ZANU-PF, making it a reliable barometer of someone s political standing. In August, the paper ran a typically fawning portrait of Grace under the headline  A Loving Mother of the Nation.   Loving mother, compassionate philanthropist, astute businesswoman, perceptive politician, remarkable patriot, these are all adjectives that can be used to describe the First Lady Dr Grace Mugabe,  The Herald gushed. Less than three months later and in the wake of a coup that threatens Mugabe s presidency and has seen both he and Grace expelled from ZANU-PF, her Herald portrayal was starkly different.  Grace Mugabe lacked grooming and true motherhood as shown by her foul language,  the paper quoted the ZANU-PF s youth wing as saying.   We take exception to the vulgar language which had become part of Mrs Mugabe s vocabulary,  it quoted a Youth League cadre as saying.  Zimbabweans, many of whom are devoutly religious and culturally conservative, often take offense at profanities.  The piece featured an unflattering picture of an unsmiling Grace - a sharp departure from the  loving mother  portrayal that included photos of her smiling and holding infants.  Until the events of the past week, the political fortunes of Grace   dubbed  Gucci Grace  for her reputed fondness shopping sprees   were on the rise, if The Herald s coverage was anything to go on. In September 2014, the University of Zimbabwe awarded her a PHD   raising eyebrows as her academic prowess had previously been unknown. But in Zimbabwe, the path to power is paved with academic letters. Weeks later, one Herald headline blared:  Dr Grace Mugabe honored in song.  At the time, she was being shoe-horned into the top position in ZANU-PF s Women s League, and the song was entitled:  Dr G Mugabe For Women s League Secretary.  Just 12 days ago, paper was reporting that the Women s League was backing Grace in her bid to become vice president. This was days after Mugabe sacked his deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa, clearing the path for Grace to assume the role and succeed her 93-year-old husband. It was this tilt at power that triggered the army backlash. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"HANOI (Reuters) - The United States and Vietnam on Tuesday signed an agreement allowing the U.S. Peace Corps to work in the country for the first time. The signing, which comes amid a historic three-day visit by President Barack Obama, follows more than a decade of negotiations between the two countries to establish a Peace Corps operation in Vietnam. The program, which is expected to begin over the next two years, allows Peace Corps volunteers to teach English in schools in the country���������s two largest cities, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, said Peace Corps Director Carrie Hessler-Radelet, who signed the agreement with Vietnam���������s ambassador to the United States, Pham Quang Vinh. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who was present for the signing, said the agreement marked a further normalizing of relations between the United States and Vietnam. ���������For 20 years now we have had what we call a normal relationship,��������� said Kerry, who in 1968 served as a young U.S. naval officer in the Vietnam War.  ���������This is normal, having the Peace Corps being able to move forward, having young Americans come here, not always young, to be able to teach English in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh is the next step forward to building the relationship between the United States and Vietnam,��������� he added. After the signing, Hessler-Radelet turned to Kerry saying: ���������You���������ve waited for this for a long time.��������� ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Saturday appointed a new top official for the southern export powerhouse province of Guangdong, whose former leader sources say is likely to be promoted to a vice premier, part of a reshuffle after the end of a Communist Party Congress. President Xi Jinping on Wednesday unveiled a new senior leadership at the end of the twice-a-decade congress, with new members appointed to the three elite party bodies that run China. Over the next few weeks and months, a series of other reshuffles will take place as the party moves people into new party and government positions and as others retire. In a brief statement, the official Xinhua news agency said that Li Xi had been moved from his post as party boss in the northeastern province of Liaoning to run Guangdong province as its party chief, replacing the incumbent, Hu Chunhua. Guangdong, which borders the former British colony of Hong Kong, is one of China s most economically important provinces. Xinhua did not say what position Hu would assume, but sources with ties to the leadership said he is likely to be promoted to become one of China s vice premiers. Hu, who spent a large part of his career working in restive Tibet, had been considered a candidate for the Standing Committee, the seven-man party body that is China s elite ruling body headed by Xi, but failed to make it on. Three sources with leadership ties told Reuters that Jiangsu party boss Li Qiang is tipped to replace Han Zheng as Shanghai party secretary.  Li is (one of) Xi Jinping s men,  one source said. Li, 58, a native of the eastern coastal province of Zhejiang, was secretary general of the provincial party committee under Xi when the latter was Zhejiang party boss from 2002 to 2007. Li will be a strong contender to be further promoted to the Standing Committee at the next congress in 2022, another source said.  He was appointed to the 25-member Politburo, which is under the Standing Committee, on Wednesday. Former Shanghai leader Han, 63, is likely to become executive or first ranked vice premier next March at the annual meeting of parliament, the sources said.  The State Council Information Office, which doubles as the party s spokesman s office, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"SAN JUAN (Reuters) - The economically struggling U.S. island territory of Puerto Rico voted overwhelmingly on Sunday in favor of becoming the 51st state, although turnout was low and adding another star to the U.S. flag likely faces an uphill battle in Congress. A government website for the non-binding referendum, Puerto Rico���������s fifth such plebiscite since 1967, showed 97 percent supported statehood. Only 23 percent of the 2.2 million eligible voters participated in the vote. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello campaigned for statehood as the best avenue to boost future growth for the island, which has $70 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate, woefully underperforming schools and near-insolvent pension and health systems. ���������From today going forward, the Federal government will no longer be able to ignore the voice of the majority of the American citizens in Puerto Rico,��������� Rossello said in a statement. ���������It would be highly contradictory for Washington to demand democracy in other parts of the world, and NOT respond to the legitimate right to self-determination that was exercised today in the American territory of Puerto Rico,��������� he added. Puerto Rico���������s hazy political status, dating back to its 1898 acquisition by the United States from Spain, has contributed to the economic crisis that pushed it last month into the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. ���������I voted for statehood,��������� Armando Abreu, a 74-year-old retiree, said after voting. ���������Even if it���������s still a long way off in the distance, it���������s our only hope.��������� Those in favor of statehood for the mainly Spanish-speaking Caribbean island hope the new status would put the territory on equal standing with the 50 U.S. states, giving them more access to federal funds and the right to vote for U.S. president. Under the current system, Puerto Rico���������s 3.5 million American citizens do not pay federal taxes, vote in presidential elections or receive proportionate federal funding on programs like the Medicaid health insurance system for the poor. The U.S. government oversees policy and financial areas such as infrastructure, defense and trade. Rossello will ask Congress to respect the result, but Puerto Rico is seen as a low priority in Washington.    The island���������s two main opposition parties boycotted the vote, which gave Puerto Ricans three options: becoming a U.S. state; remaining a territory; or becoming an independent nation, with or without some continuing political association with the United States. Puerto Rico���������s former governor, Rafael Hernandez Colon, said in a statement: ���������A contrived plebiscite fabricated an artificial majority for statehood by disenfranchising hundreds of thousands of Commonwealth supporters.��������� Rather than heading to the polls, some 500 Puerto Ricans marched on the streets of San Juan, waving Puerto Rico���������s flag and burning the American flag while chanting in support of independence.   ���������This is a bogus plebiscite. Our future is independence. We need to be able to decide our own fate,��������� said Liliana Laboy, one of the organizers of the protest. Boycotters were also angry about the costly referendum at a time when over 400 schools have closed and many Puerto Ricans are struggling to make ends meet. Schools where voting took place were in poor condition, with cracked paint and bare-bones playgrounds. Puerto Rico spent an estimated $8 million on the campaign and election process, according to a government spokesman. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"(Reuters) - Automakers could help prevent accidental deaths of small children left in hot cars by installing devices to remind drivers to check their back seats for passengers before getting out, three U.S. lawmakers sponsoring a safety measure said on Wednesday. The bipartisan group of lawmakers joined safety experts and parents with testimonials of personal tragedies to publicly press for a law they said would have averted many of the 800  deaths of children left in overheated cars since 1990. ���������It should be bipartisan, non-partisan, it should be America���������s legislation,��������� Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican told a Washington press conference. The bill, known as the Helping Overcome Trauma for Children Alone in Rear Seats, or HOT CARS, Act, would instruct the U.S. Transportation Department to issue a rule requiring new cars to have systems that alert drivers check their back seats after they turn off their engines. Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat and a chief sponsor of the bill, lauded General Motors Co for already installing rear-seat reminders in its 2018 model Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC vehicles. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said it would review the legislation and ���������provide guidance,��������� but added that under the bill it would take about 20 years before all cars were equipped with the new technology. ���������Greater public awareness saves lives today,��������� alliance spokesman Scott Hall said in a statement. Stories of children, as well as pets, who die while left unattended in hot cars tend to horrify Americans each summer. Miles Harrison of suburban Washington recounted the highly publicized death of his adopted young son, when he forgot to drop him at daycare and left him in his car at work on a hot July day nine years ago. He was tried and found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter. ���������It really did not matter to me whether I was found guilty or innocent,��������� he said. ���������I still have not forgiven myself and don���������t know if I have the capacity to do so.��������� The Russian government later used the tragedy as partial justification for banning U.S. citizens from adopting Russian orphans, naming the law after the child.

"HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnamese police on Friday arrested a former top Communist Party official suspected of misconduct while he was chairman of the main state energy firm, the first former politburo member to face prosecution in decades. Police issued arrest and prosecution orders for Dinh La Thang, 56, for suspected  violation of state regulations on economic management, causing serious consequences , the Ministry of Public Security said on its website.     Thang is the most senior official so far caught up in a widespread crackdown on fraud in the energy and banking sectors, which has gathered pace since the security establishment gained greater influence in the party last year. Police are investigating two cases related to Thang s tenure as chairman of state oil and gas firm PetroVietnam that involved a loss of investment in local Ocean Bank and suspected wrongdoing at a PetroVietnam subsidiary, PetroVietnam Construction Joint Stock Corp (PVC) (PVX.HN), police said. Thang was not available for comment. The corruption crackdown made global headlines in August when Germany accused Vietnam of kidnapping Trinh Xuan Thanh, a former chairman of PVC, in Berlin after he applied for asylum there. The party has said it aimed to let Thanh go on trial next month. Government critics have voiced suspicions that the corruption crackdown is politically motivated, at least in part, and aimed against those close to former prime minister Nguyen Tan Dung, who lost out in an internal power struggle in 2016.  This development represents a major event in Vietnamese politics and reflects a concerted effort by those in the commanding heights of the party to rein in and prosecute instances of large scale corruption and serious cases of malfeasance among high ranking party and state officials,  said Vietnam expert Jonathan London of Leiden University. Thang was dismissed from the politburo after the Communist Party found him responsible for financial losses at PetroVietnam. It also stripped him of his role as party head of Ho Chi Minh City to penalise him further.  Prosecuting a former politburo member in the one-party state is not unprecedented. In 1979, a former politburo official, Hoang Van Hoan, was handed a death sentence in absentia after he had fled the country. On Friday, police also issued an arrest order for Nguyen Quoc Khanh, a former chairman of PetroVietnam. In September, another former PetroVietnam chairman was sentenced to death for embezzlement among other crimes. Khanh was also temporarily dismissed from his current role at the trade ministry on Friday, the ministry said in a statement. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will release her 2015 tax returns and her running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, will release the last 10 years of their tax returns within days, according to a source close to Clinton. The returns will show Clinton paid an effective tax rate of 35 percent and gave about 10 percent to charity, CNBC reported. The release comes as Republican Donald Trump is facing criticism for not releasing his tax returns - a political practice that is not required by law but has been done by every White House nominee since 1973. ���������He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns,��������� Clinton said on Thursday in an economic speech in Michigan.   Clinton���������s campaign has already released tax returns going back to 2007. In addition, tax returns are publicly available for the eight years her husband, former President Bill Clinton, was in the White House. Prior years were released by his campaign. Tax returns filed by the Clintons have been made public, in some form, for every year back to 1977. Trump, a New York businessman, has refused to release his tax returns, saying they are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. He has said he is unlikely to do so before the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have blasted Trump for failing to disclose his tax rate and raised questions about what his returns say about his net worth and various business ties, particularly in Russia.     Asked in a television interview in May what tax rate he pays, Trump replied ���������It���������s none of your business.��������� The IRS has said Trump can release his tax returns even while under audit. Besides showing sources and amounts of income, tax returns show what percentage tax rate a person ultimately pays, as well as how much they claimed in deductions and the amounts given to charities.   Earlier this month, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, billionaire investor Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to make his returns public. ���������I���������m under audit, too, and I would be delighted to meet him anyplace, anytime, before the election,��������� Buffett said. ���������I���������ll bring my tax return, he can bring his tax return ... and let people ask us questions.��������� Trump has declined to do so.

"WASHINGTON/BANGKOK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha at the White House on Oct. 3, the White House said in a statement. ���������The President and Prime Minister will discuss ways to strengthen and broaden bilateral relations and enhance cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region,��������� the statement said. Confirmation of the visit is the latest sign of warming ties between Bangkok and Washington. The relationship between the two had cooled after the Thai military took power in a 2014 coup. It follows a visit to Thailand by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in August - the highest level visit by a U.S. official since the 2014 coup. ���������The meeting of the two leaders reflects the importance of the strengthening of the alliance between Thailand and the U.S.,��������� the Thai Prime Minister���������s Office said in a statement. ���������The two countries will discuss ways to forge ahead in becoming strategic partners for the benefit of both nations equally and sustainable,���������  Prayuth and members of his cabinet will also be meeting with representatives of Thai businesses in the United States during the three day visit. Thailand is often cited as the United States��������� oldest ally in Southeast Asia and the United States has been urging the region to do more to cut funding streams to North Korea. Tensions have mounted on the Korean peninsula since North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3. The United States has said it believes North Korean front companies are active in Thailand and it is trying to encourage the Thais to shut them down, but Thailand last month said trade between Thailand and North Korea had dropped by as much as 94 percent over the past year.

"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain said on Sunday he would like relations between United States and Pakistan to improve as they have a common enemy in the Islamic State and other radical Islamist groups. Relations between Pakistan and United States have been frayed over the past decade, with U.S. officials frustrated by what they term Islamabad���������s unwillingness to act against Islamist groups such as the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network. Pakistan rejects harboring militants but says there are limits to how much it can do as it is already fighting multiple Islamist groups and is wary of ���������blowback��������� in the form of more terror attacks on its soil.  McCain, visiting Pakistan as part of a U.S. delegation, said he had an ���������excellent meeting��������� with Pakistani foreign ministry officials. ���������We come back with a message that we have a common enemy in ISIS, radical Islam and terrorism, and we look forward to closer relations and resolving the differences we have,��������� McCain told Pakistan���������s national PTV channel. Relations between United States and Pakistan were tested again in May by a U.S. drone strike that killed Afghan Taliban chief Mullah Akhtar Mansour on Pakistani soil.  As part of the visit, McCain traveled to Miranshah, the capital of the restive North Waziristan region bordering Afghanistan. The region was effectively run Islamists by groups such as the Pakistani Taliban and the Haqqani network until the Pakistani military launched operations against them in 2014. ���������I was very impressed with the progress (on the ground),��������� said McCain, who is the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ���������I see us working together in confronting a common challenge ��������� radical Islamic terrorism ��������� and these kinds of meetings are very helpful to both those countries,��������� McCain added. The Islamic State has struggled to gain a major foothold in Pakistan, analysts say, but officials worry the group may pose a threat in the future.  Pakistan said the country���������s top foreign policy official Sartaj Aziz had briefed the U.S. delegation - which includes Senators Lindsey Graham, Benjamin Sasse and Joe Donnelly - about faltering peace talks to end the civil war in Afghanistan. So far China, United States and Pakistan have struggled to persuade the Afghan Taliban to meaningfully embrace the talks. ���������No country had as much vital stakes in the success of these joint efforts, as Pakistan, (Aziz) remarked,��������� Pakistan���������s foreign ministry said in a statement.

"GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. independent investigator into human rights in Myanmar called on Wednesday for stronger international pressure to be exerted on Myanmar s military commanders after being barred from visiting the country for the rest of her tenure.  Yanghee Lee, U.N. special rapporteur, had been due to visit in January to assess human rights across Myanmar, including alleged abuses against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State. But Myanmar had told her she was no longer welcome, she said, adding in a statement that this suggested something  terribly awful  was happening in the country.   From what I see right now I m not sure if they are feeling pressured. I m not sure if there is the right kind of pressure placed on the military commanders and the generals,  she later told Reuters by telephone from Seoul. She said it was alarming that Myanmar was strongly supported by China, which has a veto at the U.N. s top table in New York. Other countries including the United States and human groups were advocating targeted sanctions on the military, she said.  It has to work. And I m sure the world has to find a way to make it work. And I think the United Nations and its member states should really try to persuade China to really act towards the protection of human rights,  she said. Surveys of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh by aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres have shown at least 6,700 Rohingya were killed in Rakhine state in the month after violence flared up on Aug 25, the aid group said last week. More than 650,000 Rohingya have fled into Bangladesh since Aug. 25, when attacks by Muslim insurgents on the Myanmar security forces triggered a sweeping response by the army and Buddhist vigilantes. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the situation in Rakhine State was an internal affair for Myanmar with its own complex history. Myanmar and Bangladesh resolving this issue was the only way to go, she told reporters. The international community should provide constructive help for Myanmar and Bangladesh to resolve the issue rather than complicating it, Hua added. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein has called the violence  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing  and said he would not be surprised if a court eventually ruled that genocide had taken place.     Lee had planned to use her visit to find out procedures for the return of Rohingya refugees, and to investigate increased fighting in Kachin State and Shan Sate in northern Myanmar, where the military is battling autonomy-seeking ethic minority guerrillas. Lee, in an earlier statement, said Myanmar s refusal to cooperate with her was a strong indication that there must be  something terribly awful happening  throughout the country, although the government had repeatedly denied any violations of human rights.  They have said that they have nothing to hide, but their lack of cooperation with my mandate and the fact-finding mission suggests otherwise,  she said. She was  puzzled and disappointed , since Myanmar s ambassador in Geneva, Htin Lynn, had told the U.N. Human Rights Council only two weeks ago that it would cooperate.  Now I am being told that this decision to no longer cooperate with me is based on the statement I made after I visited the country in July,  she said. Htin Lynn did not respond to a request for comment. Neither Zaw Htay, spokesman for Myanmar government leader Aung San Suu Kyi, nor Kyaw Moe Tun, a spokesman for the ministry of foreign affairs that Suu Kyi heads, were immediately available.

"(Reuters) - The U.S wind energy industry on Friday cheered a Senate tax proposal that, unlike the House version unveiled last week, preserves the tax credit that helps wind farms compete with plants fired by fossil fuels. The Senate plan brought relief to an industry that has spent the last week warning lawmakers on Capitol Hill that changes to the credit would put $50 billion in planned investment at risk. However, if the House and Senate pass their differing proposals on the Republicans��������� broad tax-cut plan, a House-Senate committee will need to reconcile the differences and both chambers will have to approve the resulting compromise legislation, so it is too soon to know if the tax overhaul will ultimately preserve the wind energy credit. MidAmerican Energy said on Thursday that if the bill passed as the House proposed, the Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) unit could be forced to cancel $4.3 billion of wind investments in Iowa, affecting 400 jobs and prompting the loss of $10 million a year in property tax and landowner payments. The wind industry���������s production tax credit was extended by Congress in 2015 and awards a credit for every kilowatt-hour of energy produced from wind projects. Investors and project developers had banked on the stability of the policy, which is scheduled to phase out by 2020, in planning their investments. ���������The Senate tax reform bill keeps a promise to America���������s more than 100,000 wind energy workers and restores the confidence of businesses pouring billions of dollars into rural America,��������� Tom Kiernan, Chief Executive of the American Wind Energy Association trade group said in a statement.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren will keep up her assault on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday in a strongly worded speech labeling Trump a racist and accusing the Republican Party of fostering his intolerance. ���������Donald Trump chose racism as his weapon, but his aim is exactly the same as the rest of the Republicans,��������� Warren will say in remarks to be delivered at a Washington meeting of the American Constitution Society, a liberal group. Warren, a fiery critic of Wall Street, is a favorite among liberals as a possible running mate for Hillary Clinton, who this week became the presumptive Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Trump has drawn strong criticism, including from some Republican leaders, for his attacks on Mexican-American U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is overseeing fraud lawsuits against his now defunct real estate training school. The Republican candidate has accused Curiel, an American  born in Indiana, of having an inherent bias against him because of his heritage and Trump���������s campaign pledges on curbing illegal immigration, such as building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. ���������Judge Curiel is one of countless American patriots who has spent decades quietly serving his country, sometimes at great risk to his own life,��������� Warren will say. ���������Donald Trump is a loud, nasty, thin-skinned fraud who has never risked anything for anyone and serves nobody but himself.���������     Thursday���������s remarks will be just the latest in a war of words between Trump and Warren. Trump has dubbed Warren ���������goofy,��������� and often taunts her on the campaign trail, while Warren has branded Trump a ���������loser��������� and last month tweeted that his ���������record is embarrassing.��������� Reuters reported on Wednesday that Warren will soon endorse Clinton, after months of remaining neutral in the Democratic primary battle between Clinton and her challenger from the left, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted on Tuesday to confirm attorney Jay Clayton to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency tasked with policing and writing rules for Wall Street. In a 61-37 vote, the Senate approved the nomination, with some moderate Democrats joining their Republican colleagues in supporting his confirmation. Clayton could be officially sworn in as SEC chairman as soon as Thursday. The White House still must complete some paperwork, including an action by President Trump to formally designate him as SEC chairman. Clayton is a longtime partner at law firm Sullivan & Cromwell who specializes in advising clients on public and private mergers and acquisitions and capital-raising efforts.  Clayton worked on the initial public offering of Alibaba Group Holding Company, and has also represented Goldman Sachs, where his wife Gretchen works.  She is now expected to step down from her post, a move that will make it easier for her husband to mitigate potential conflicts of interest. ���������I look forward to working closely with my fellow Commissioners and the dedicated career staff at the SEC to serve the American public and advance the SEC���������s important mission,��������� Clayton said in a statement. Many current and former SEC staffers are optimistic about Clayton���������s leadership, and Clayton is expected to focus some of his efforts on looking for ways to ease regulatory burdens that might hinder companies from raising capital. But in the debate leading up to the Senate vote on Tuesday, more progressive-leaning Democrats said they were concerned his close ties to Wall Street will create too many conflicts and may lead to weaker oversight. ���������Mr. Clayton���������s law firm and former clients will create a steady stream of conflicts for him, forcing him to recuse himself in cases involving former clients for two of the four years he could serve as chair,��������� said Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee.  ���������He will be sitting on the sidelines of potential enforcement actions against some of the biggest Wall Street banks - Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, and UBS,��������� he added.

"(Reuters) - The secretaries of the U.S. Treasury and Health and Human Services called for fast congressional action to help Puerto Rico out of its economic mess, and said a bipartisan task force report failed to go far enough on recommending a low-income tax credit for the commonwealth. In a letter to U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell reaffirmed calls to step up healthcare funding for Puerto Rico. ���������We write to underscore the need for additional legislation early in this (congressional) session to address the economic and fiscal crisis in Puerto Rico,��������� the letter said. They noted that 900,000 Puerto Ricans could risk losing healthcare unless Congress took action by April. The U.S. territory is hampered by $70 billion in debt, unemployment more than twice the U.S. average, a 45 percent poverty rate and a decreasing population as locals flock to the U.S. mainland. A congressional task force of U.S. senators and congressmen in December recommended several fixes for Puerto Rico, including boosting healthcare funding and exploring giving the island access to the federal Earned Income Tax Credit. The benefit for low- to moderate-income workers has been used to combat poverty, and the Obama Administration has proposed expanding it to Puerto Rico. If the credit exceeds a worker���������s income tax liability, the government will refund the balance. The report did not go far enough with the tax credit, Lew and Burwell said, calling the benefit a ���������powerful economic driver.��������� The task force report described healthcare in Puerto Rico as ���������a serious and urgent issue,��������� but did not agree on solutions. For decades, the United States offered lower payments to most island residents under the federally sponsored Medicare and Medicaid insurance programs.������Funding for the Medicaid program for the poor, for example, has been capped by Washington, spurring island officials to borrow heavily through municipal bonds.

"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte voiced rare praise for the United States on Thursday, calling it an important security ally, and dismissing historic grievances and his slew of past tirades against Washington as  water under the bridge . Duterte s anti-American outbursts have become notorious and baffling for one of Washington s closest Asian allies since the nation gained independence from the United States in 1946. He was speaking on the 116th anniversary of one of the bloodiest battles in the American-Philippines war on the central island of Samar, where 39 Filipino civilians were killed in retaliation for the deaths of 48 soldiers killed by rebels. Last year, at his first international summit in Laos, the maverick leader stunned regional leaders when he showed them pictures of that massacre. Then U.S. President Barack Obama canceled a bilateral meeting there with Duterte, who had called him a  son of a bitch  days earlier for expressing concern about his bloody war on drugs. On Thursday, Duterte said he had been advised to tone down his anti-American rhetoric and had positive words for the U.S. military, with which he has repeatedly threatened to sever ties, besides accusing it of supplying ineffective combat hardware and of making the Philippines a potential target for war.  This is all water under the bridge, I was under advice by the Department of Foreign Affairs, that I would temper my language and avoid cursing, which I am prone to do if I get emotional,  Duterte said in a speech.  I would not say they were our saviours, but they are our allies and they helped us. Even today, they provide crucial equipment to our soldiers in Marawi to fight the terrorists,  he said, referring to a city where Islamic State loyalists have been holed up for four months. Duterte was speaking in Balangiga, a town burned down in 1901 by U.S. soldiers, who seized two church bells as war trophies. Duterte has demanded the return of the bells and the two countries are now discussing the terms. Since Donald Trump replaced Obama as president, Duterte s attacks on the United States have decreased, though he vowed never to go there and last week passed up the opportunity to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Duterte sprang a surprise last month with a warm reception for visiting U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, describing himself as a  humble friend  of the United States.  Some commentators have attributed his softer tone to the Trump administration refraining from criticism of Duterte s signature war on drugs. Duterte s foreign minister Alan Peter Cayetano, who met Tillerson in Washington on Wednesday, said the Philippines was open to receiving foreign observers to examine its human rights record and war on drugs, which has killed thousands.  We made it clear that we have nothing to hide and are ready to work with experts or observers as long as they are independent and fair,  Cayetano said in a statement.

"(Reuters) - A Nevada judge on Tuesday rejected Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump���������s request for records from a Las Vegas polling place that the campaign said had allowed people to vote after a deadline last week. Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton are in a close contest for Nevada���������s six electoral votes in Tuesday���������s election after a long and contentious campaign. Nevada is one of several states that permits early voting, and Las Vegas is viewed as a base of support for Clinton. Nevada state law says voters who are in line at 8 p.m., when the polls close, must be allowed to cast their ballots. Trump���������s lawsuit, filed in a Nevada state court on Monday, said election officials violated state law because they allowed people to join the line after 8 p.m. at a polling location at a Latino market during last week���������s early voting period.  Trump, a New York businessman and reality TV personality who had never previously run for political office, said last month that he might not accept the outcome of the national election if he thinks it is unfair. ���������Today may be the last time that ordinary citizens are able to stand up and say ���������No��������� to an overreaching, unaccountable government controlled by a ruling establishment,��������� Charles Munoz, the Nevada state director for Trump���������s campaign, said in a statement after the ruling.  The suit had asked the court to order officials to preserve various records from the Cardenas Market and to segregate ballots from the voting machines at issue.  At a court hearing in Las Vegas on Tuesday, a county attorney argued that election officials already preserve records. Sturman agreed, saying she did not want to issue an order that could help reveal which candidates were chosen by particular voters.  The Trump campaign also asked for information about poll workers on duty at the market, and Sturman said she was concerned they might face threats for helping people vote. ���������Have you watched Twitter? Do you watch any cable news shows? People can get information and harass them,��������� the judge said. Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin said the campaign was pleased by the ruling. He described Trump���������s suit as ���������a desperate response to the record turnout we���������re seeing in Nevada and across the country.��������� Dan Kulin, a spokesman for the Clark County Office of Public Communications, said that when early voting was taking place on Friday ���������most if not all��������� polling places had lines at the time they were scheduled to close.  ���������As has been our practice for many, many years, those early voting locations continued processing voters until the lines were gone,��������� Kulin said.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill on Thursday said she drafted a bill stating that tribal sovereign immunity cannot be used to block U.S. Patent and Trademark Office review of a patent.  Drugmaker Allergan Plc made a deal to transfer some of its patents to a Native American tribe two weeks ago in order to shield them from review.  McCaskill���������s response follows a bipartisan U.S. House of Representatives committee decision to investigate the deal earlier this week and previous calls by Democratic Senators for a probe. ���������Any thinking person would look at what this company did and say, ���������That should be illegal.��������� Well, I agree,��������� McCaskill said in a statement. ���������Congress never imagined tribes would allow themselves to be used by pharmaceutical companies to avoid challenges to patents, and this bill will shut the practice down before others follow suit.��������� Allergan was not immediately available for comment. Allergan said last month that it was transferring patents on its blockbuster dry eye medication Restasis to New York���������s Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, which agreed to exclusively license them back to the company in exchange for ongoing payments. The Tribe issued a statement expressing outrage at McCaskill���������s move and accused the senator of engaging in double standards. It said the proposed legislation ���������specifically targets Indian tribes, yet exempts state universities and other sovereign governments engaged in the very same IPR (inter partes review) process.��������� Allergan has argued that the legal maneuver is aimed at removing administrative patent challenges through inter partes review by the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and not challenges in federal court. The drugmaker said it believes that the patents should not be subject to the IPR process - which Allergan has called flawed and broken - because of the tribe���������s sovereign immunity. The company still faces a challenge to the patents in federal court. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday released a 58-page draft plan to reverse the landmark 2015 ���������net neutrality��������� order and disclosed the agency may withdraw ���������bright line��������� rules barring internet companies from blocking, throttling or giving ���������fast lanes��������� to some websites. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, named by Trump in January, disclosed his intent Wednesday to repeal the Obama era rules that reclassified internet service and tightly regulated providers as if they were utilities. The FCC also plans to scrap the 2015 internet conduct standard and an ombudsman position created to hear complaints of net neutrality violations. The plan asks if network disclosure requirements should remain in force for internet providers. Pai���������s plan faces an initial May 18 vote. He wants public comment on whether the FCC should keep its ���������bright line��������� rules, and said his decision on the rules would depend partly on the comments the agency receives. Websites such as Facebook Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and others back the rules, saying they guarantee equal access to the internet. Internet service providers such as AT&T Inc (T.N), Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) oppose the Obama order, saying they made it harder to manage internet traffic and discouraged investment in improving access. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn and Federal Trade Commissioner Terrell McSweeny opposed Pai���������s plan, saying it ���������would allow broadband providers to erect barriers or charge tolls to any application, connected device, or website that the broadband providers��������� customers want to reach. It would allow broadband providers to favor their own content over others, and pick winners and losers on the internet.��������� Pai said the 2015 open internet rules were unnecessary because large internet providers did not block websites before they were imposed. ���������We were not living in some digital dystopia before the partisan imposition of a massive plan hatched in Washington saved all of us,��������� Pai said Wednesday. The FCC proposal seeks comment ���������on whether a codified no-blocking rule is needed to protect such freedoms.��������� The order also asks whether a legal bar on throttling ���������is still necessary, particularly for smaller providers.��������� The proposal also questions the ban on ���������paid prioritization��������� that the proposal argues was adopted to ���������address an apparently nonexistent problem.��������� AT&T said the question ���������is not whether the internet will remain open - it undoubtedly will. The question is how, as a country, we will regulate the internet ecosystem.��������� ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump often tells crowds at his campaign rallies that he doesn���������t need outside financial support to get to the White House, but some of his fans are starting to feel differently. Donors to an independent political spending group formed to promote Trump���������s candidacy said in interviews on Sunday they were worried by reports describing the millions of dollars Trump���������s opponents are spending to attack him. They said they admired the billionaire businessman���������s professed financial independence but thought a cash boost would help keep his fight for the Republican U.S. nomination fair. So 767 people sent in small sums - $25 here, $100 there - hoping it would help prepare him to face his many, moneyed foes. ���������He needs all the help he can get,��������� said Diane Abair, 83, a real estate agent in Redding, California, who sent $50 to the group, Great America PAC. She said she didn���������t think her donation tarnished Trump���������s claim that he won���������t have to pander as president to any special interest groups because he���������s not backed by big donors. ���������I���������m not somebody that he can be beholden to,��������� she said. Trump is facing an onslaught of attacks from other Republicans alarmed by his success, even after controversial statements like his call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. Big donors who demurred for months have begun to spend heavily to defeat him. This poses a new challenge for the candidate, who has so far spent less than his opponents. Between June and February, he loaned his campaign $24 million and raised nearly $10 million more from small donors.  Hope Hicks, Trump���������s spokeswoman, did not respond to a request for comment. Great America raised just under $74,000 during the first two months of 2016, according to regulatory filings. Its co-chair, Eric Beach, said it had taken in enough since then to commit to  spending $1 million on pro-Trump ads. Beach, a California businessman and political strategist, gave $25,000. ���������When it comes time for the general election I hope the PAC has got some money left because he���������s going to need it,��������� said Scott Abadie, 54, a veterinarian in New Orleans who donated $100 to Great America PAC. The group gives $5 of each donation it receives directly to Trump���������s campaign. According to co-founder Amy Kremer, this allows each donor to be named individually on financial reports. ���������They too can be recognized for even a small donation,��������� she said.

"OSLO (Reuters) - A former senior Norwegian police officer was sentenced to 21 years in prison on Monday for aiding drug smugglers and taking bribes in a case that captivated a nation accustomed to clean law enforcement. Eirik Jensen, 60, now retired, was once in charge of combating Oslo s criminal gangs. He had denied the accusations against him and his lawyer said he would appeal. Prosecutors accused Jensen of aiding a smuggling ring for more than a decade by providing information on police and customs staffing, much of it via hundreds of cryptic mobile phone text messages, in return for illegal payments. Jensen s co-defendant Gjermund Cappelen, who admitted organizing the imports of tonnes of hashish, was the prosecution s key witness and was sentenced to 15 years in prison.  This case is unique in Norwegian legal history,  Oslo District Court Judge Kim Heger said as he read the unanimous verdict against the police officer.  Jensen has actively and deliberately contributed to a well-organized and extensive import of hashish,  he said. Jensen and his lawyers argued during the trial that the evidence of contact with criminals was merely a result of normal police work intended to extract information and that he had not received any money or gifts.  We lost the battle, but we hope to win the war,  Jensen s attorney John Christian Elden told reporters after the verdict was made public.  There will be an appeal.  Such cases are rare in Norway, ranked the world s sixth-least corrupt country by watchdog Transparency International, and this case generated vast media coverage, including an unusual live television broadcast of parts of the trial. In neighboring Finland, also among the least corrupt nations, the former head of Helsinki s drug squad was sentenced last year to 10 years in prison for drug smuggling, official misconduct and other crimes, including tampering with evidence. That case is the subject of an appeal. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is seeking  a new era  for Zimbabwe, the State Department s top official for Africa said on Thursday, implicitly calling on long-time President Robert Mugabe to step aside as a political crisis mounts. In an interview with Reuters, acting Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Donald Yamamoto appeared to dismiss the idea of Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years, remaining in a transitional or ceremonial role.   It s a transition to a new era for Zimbabwe, that s really what we re hoping for,  Yamamoto said. Zimbabwe s army seized power this week, in an apparent effort to prevent Mugabe, 93, from handing power to his wife. He has not resigned or been formally deposed, however, and he was pictured on Thursday shaking hands with the military chief, Constantino Chiwenga. Yamamoto, speaking on the sidelines of a meeting with African Union officials at the State Department in Washington, described the situation in Zimbabwe as  very fluid.  The United States would discuss lifting multiple U.S. sanctions on Zimbabwe if it began enacting political and economic reforms, he said. In a message for Zimbabwe s political leaders, he said:  Our position has always been that if they engage in the constitutional reforms, economic and political reforms, and move forward to protecting political space and the human rights, then we can start the dialogue on lifting sanctions.  The United States has not given aid to Zimbabwe s government for many years, but provides development aid to nongovernmental groups, particularly for healthcare.  Now whether we give to the government, that depends on what happens in Zimbabwe,  Yamamoto said. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is due to meet on Friday in Washington with 37 African foreign ministers.   ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"SEOUL (Reuters) - Propaganda fliers presumed to be from North Korea and calling U.S. President Donald Trump a  mad dog  have turned up across central Seoul, including near the presidential Blue House, according to posts on social media and people who found them.  Death to old lunatic Trump!  reads one poster, with a North Korean soldier with rifle in hand, crushing what looks to be Trump s head with his tongue dangling out of his mouth. Near the soldier s head is the line:  Complete obliteration.  Another poster shows Trump with the body of a dog being decapitated by an axe. Blood is shown splattered on the axe in the poster, which states:  Let s behead mad dog Trump for the future of a peaceful and warless world and mankind!  Both were in color. It is not difficult to find North Korean propaganda posters in South Korea, usually flown by balloon over the highly fortified demilitarized zone. Military images and anti-U.S. threats are common in North Korea propaganda as Pyongyang demands the United States cease what it says is its preparations for invasion. But the new series of fliers posted recently on Twitter and other social media target Trump specifically. Trump last month, in a speech to the United Nations, threatened to  totally destroy  North Korea if needed to defend itself and allies and called the North s leader Kim Jong Un a  rocket man  on a suicide mission.  I am pretty sure it came from North Korea by balloon, since the prevailing winds during October have been from north to south and we ve been getting reports of others finding them throughout Seoul,  said Chad O Carroll, managing director of NK News, a Seoul-based news subscription service, who found the leaflets while jogging in central Seoul. In an apparent jab at Trump s U.N. speech, one of the propaganda posters featured Trump standing behind a podium with a rocket in his mouth painted with the words  totally destroy North Korea . Again, Trump is depicted as a dog with a human face and labeled as  mad dog Trump . Men in suits with surprised looks on their faces are shown in the poster saying  He s gone completely insane  and  If we let him be, there will be war . Reclusive North Korea, which has carried out a series of nuclear and missile tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions, and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The North regularly threatens to destroy the South and its main ally, the United States. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The conservative House Freedom Caucus came out in support of a reworked U.S. healthcare overhaul bill even though it would not fully repeal Democratic former President Barack Obama���������s signature healthcare law, the group said in a statement on Wednesday. The group last month helped sink an effort to pass a Republican healthcare overhaul, called the American Health Care Act. But it remained unclear whether the amended bill could win enough support from moderate Republicans to get the 216 votes needed to pass the U.S. House of Representatives given unanimous Democratic opposition. ���������While the revised version still does not fully repeal Obamacare, we are prepared to support it to keep our promise to the American people to lower healthcare costs,��������� the House Freedom Caucus said in a statement posted on the website of its chairman, Republican Representative Mark Meadows. Republicans in Congress have made repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, a central campaign promise for seven years. Republican President Donald Trump also made it a top campaign promise.  The Republican healthcare bill would replace Obamacare���������s income-based tax credit with a flat age-based credit, roll back an expansion of the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor and repeal most Obamacare taxes. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated 24 million fewer people would have insurance under the bill.   In its statement, the House Freedom Caucus said it welcomed an amendment that would let states seek waivers from some Obamacare requirements, including the highly popular provision mandating that insurers charge those with pre-existing conditions the same as healthy consumers and that insurers cover so-called essential health benefits, such as maternity care.  The amendment was hammered out between Meadows and Representative Tom MacArthur, a leader of the so-called Tuesday Group of Republican moderates in the House.  Yet several moderates said on Wednesday they had not yet made a decision on whether to support the bill while others remained opposed. Some complained that they had not been part of discussions drafting the amendment, saying they had only seen it after it was released. ���������It doesn���������t address any of the concerns I���������ve been raising for weeks,��������� said Republican Representative Charlie Dent, including how to reform Medicaid.  Republican Representative Chris Collins, another member of the Tuesday Group, said pressure to follow through on Republicans��������� top campaign promise for the past seven years had shifted from the party���������s conservative wing to the moderates. ���������We need to get this passed to fulfill our campaign promise, and this is the compromise that looks like it will make it happen,��������� he said. Republican leaders have not scheduled a vote on the bill. They said they would do so when they are confident they have the votes needed for passage.  ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress was ironing out a new plan on Wednesday to rescue Puerto Rico from crippling debts that threaten the island territory���������s funding for hospitals and emergency services, as the treatment of bondholders simmers as a point of contention. The Obama administration and congressional Democrats raised concerns about legislation being floated by Republicans. It would steer creditors and holders of Puerto Rico bonds toward a new, independent board that would seek a fair way to write down an estimated $70 billion in debt. Puerto Rico���������s economy has struggled for years and the U.S. territory���������s government has borrowed heavily to pay its bills. Its bankruptcy reorganization options are limited under present law and Congress has become involved. The Republican bill ���������imposes an unworkable, mandatory process��������� on debt restructurings ���������that will only delay the ability to reach a comprehensive resolution,��������� Treasury Department Counselor Antonio Weiss told a congressional panel. All of Puerto Rico���������s many debtors ���������would have to complete a complicated process before any single entity could begin to restructure,��������� Weiss said in prepared testimony to the U.S. House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee, which hopes to advance legislation soon. Republicans control the U.S. Congress, but they likely will need support from Democrats to pass a rescue plan. Weiss painted a dire picture of Puerto Rico, where he said essential government services are being curtailed because of a lack of cash, hospitals have closed some floors amid layoffs, and fuel for emergency vehicles is running dry. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, speaking to reporters,  complained of television ads airing in some parts of the United States that she said were misleading. The actions being weighed, Pelosi said, ���������do not cost the taxpayers one dollar.��������� Pelosi said Democrats are concerned ���������about the negative impact of the legislation on working people in Puerto Rico, as well as the effects of transferring federal lands on Vieques without providing for strong conservation protections.���������  If the House committee can amend the bill in a way that a majority of members approve, it would advance to the full House. Many investors would face a loss under the Republican plan and are lobbying Congress to protect their bottom lines. The rescue plan adopts some principles of bankruptcy law, and some lawmakers have balked at the idea of letting Puerto Rico modify its bonds, saying it would create chaos for municipal markets.

"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A senior Texas health official who co-authored a report that criticized the state���������s funding cuts to Planned Parenthood for reducing access to reproductive healthcare will retire from his post next month, a Texas commission said on Friday. Rick Allgeyer, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission���������s director of research, faced criticism from the state���������s Republican leaders over the report published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine this month. The report said state funding cuts to Planned Parenthood and its affiliates had an adverse effect on family planning for lower-income people. Allgeyer is eligible to retire and decided to do so effective on March 31, the commission said. Allgeyer, who has been at the commission for 16 years and was one of the study���������s five listed authors, declined to comment. In 2011, the Texas state legislature cut Planned Parenthood out of one family-planning program and revamped the way another program hands out funds, placing it and other private clinics at the bottom of the list. Top Texas political leaders have said after cutting off funding for Planned Parenthood that the state has been able to rebuild its safety net.  Independent health experts dispute the claim, saying Texas still has a long way to go before it can provide the level of service it did when Planned Parenthood was an integral part of its family planning efforts. The Texas plan has garnered attention among Republicans in the U.S. Congress who are looking to defund the nation���������s largest family-planning provider at the national level.    The study said the cuts appeared to lead to an increase of unintended pregnancies among lower-income residents and a decrease in access to long-acting reversible contraception. It also said the cuts appeared to increase the rate of childbirths covered by Medicaid. Some Texas Republicans said it was inappropriate for a state employee to be involved in such a study and that its results were flawed, putting political pressure on Allgeyer.

"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia, concerned about rising Chinese influence, will ban foreign political donations as part of a crackdown aimed at preventing external interference in domestic politics, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Tuesday. Turnbull told reporters in Canberra that foreign powers were making  unprecedented and increasingly sophisticated attempts to influence the political process  in Australia and the world. He cited  disturbing reports about Chinese influence . Australia and neighbouring New Zealand are among roughly a third of countries worldwide that allow foreign donations to political parties. Such donations are prohibited in the United States, Britain and several European countries. Australia s new laws, modelled in part on the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act, would criminalise foreign interference and require the registration of lobbyists working for nation states, Turnbull said. The announcement came as concern grows that Beijing may be extending its influence and as relationships between Australian politicians and Chinese government interests have become increasingly contentious. Fairfax Media and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported in June on a concerted campaign by China to  infiltrate  Australian politics to promote Chinese interests. China denies the claims.  In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China had no intention of interfering with Australia s internal affairs or using political funding to influence them.    At the same time, we want to again urge Australia to remove their biases and take an objective and positive attitude to assess China and its relations with Australia,  he added. However, leading opposition Senator Sam Dastyari quit some senior Labor Party positions last week after a tape surfaced of him appearing to endorse China s contentious expansion in disputed areas of the South China Sea, against his party s platform. The tape, which showed him standing next to property developer Huang Xiangmo, a major Chinese political donor, was leaked to the media.  I take those reports, as do my colleagues, very seriously,  Turnbull said. However, the new laws  are not about any one country , he said.  Foreign interference is a global issue ... for example, we re all familiar with very credible reports that Russia sought to actively undermine the United States  election ... the threat is real,  Turnbull said. The new laws, should they pass parliament, would ban foreign donations to political parties or any political group that has spent more than A$100,000 ($76,350) campaigning in the past four years - a rule that could also likely affect environmental and other campaign groups. Australia expressed deep concern last month over a crackdown on pro-democracy groups in Cambodia. Despite that, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said foreign donations to activist group GetUp!, a non-partisan but vocal critic of the centre-right government, would be banned under Australia s new laws. GetUp! said in a statement only 0.5 percent of its donations come from overseas. It criticised the proposed laws as an attempt to avoid scrutiny of government policies and for failing to curtail donations from multinational corporations. The definitions of treason and espionage would also be broadened under the new laws to include possessing or receiving sensitive information, rather than just transmitting it. Since the controversial sale of the port of Darwin to a Chinese company in 2015, the government has been at pains to demonstrate limits to its ties to China, its biggest export partner, blocking sales of Australia s biggest cattle station and biggest power grid to Chinese interests.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate confirmed President Donald Trump���������s pick to run the government health program for the elderly, poor and disabled on Monday, filling a critical role as Republicans fight to repeal and replace Obamacare.  ������������������������The Senate voted 55-43 to approve Seema Verma to run the $1 trillion Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Verma is the owner of SVC Inc, a healthcare consulting firm, and has helped redesign Medicaid programs in several states, including Indiana when Vice President Mike Pence was governor. ������������������ Verma will report to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. Price and Verma are expected to make changes to many of the Medicaid and Medicare programs that were implemented under the signature legislation of former Democratic President Barack Obama, the 2010 Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare. ������������������ Republicans unveiled their plan to repeal and replace much of Obamacare last week. The proposal would roll back an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor and replace Obamacare���������s income-based tax credits with flat, age-based credits. The bill passed two House committees last week and goes to the House Budget Committee this week. A study of the Republican healthcare measure released on Monday by the nonpartisan U.S. Congressional Budget Office found that 14 million Americans would lose medical insurance by next year if the program is approved. It said 24 million more people would be uninsured by 2026 under the program. Price told reporters at the White House that the administration strongly disagreed with the findings, saying the CBO had not looked at the full plan to reform Obamacare. ������������������ If the Republican healthcare bill passes the House and Senate and is signed into law by Trump, Verma will play a major role in implementing the law, called the American Health Care Act. ������ ������������Verma worked in Indiana to expand Medicaid to include thousands of additional low-income residents. Those residents are required to make small monthly payments toward their care through health savings accounts.  ������������������������Verma���������s confirmation was not without controversy early on. In an initial committee hearing, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said that while helping manage the state of Indiana���������s health program, her firm was being paid by companies that were providing services and products to the program. ������������������ Verma has denied wrongdoing and said she would divest her financial interest in SVC within 90 days of confirmation.

"MOSCOW (Reuters) - North Korea has petitioned the Russian parliament to help 3,500 migrant workers from the isolated Asian country stay in Russia despite new U.N. sanctions, the Interfax news agency reported on Friday, citing a Russian lawmaker. Tougher sanctions on North Korea, imposed by the United Nations Security Council over Pyongyang s ballistic missile and nuclear programs on Sept. 11, banned countries from providing new work permits for North Korean nationals, but allowed existing workers to remain. Most of the around 30,000-40,000 North Korean migrants legally working in Russia were hired before the new sanctions entered into force and the ban will not affect them, Interfax said, quoting an earlier statement from Maxim Topilin, Russia s labor minister.  But the ban could apply to 3,500 workers who only signed their contracts in September, the month when the U.N. Security Council, including Russia, voted for the new sanctions, Interfax reported. It cited Kazbek Taysayev, a lawmaker in the lower house of parliament and a member of a  friendship group  between the Russian and North Korean parliaments, as saying:  North Korea s embassy officially addressed us. We supported them and sent our petitions in order to let these people stay so that they can work.  Even if the workers signed their contracts after the ban took effect, they had started making arrangements and preparing the documents earlier and could be allowed to stay, said Taysayev.  The U.N. resolution said it did not apply to work permits  for which written contracts have been finalized prior to the adoption of this resolution.

"CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has shifted $81 million in funds from other projects to continue work on developing vaccines to fight Zika in the absence of any funding from U.S. lawmakers. In a letter addressed to Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat and minority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said she was allocating $34 million in funding to the National Institutes of Health and $47 million to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to work on Zika vaccines. Burwell said the funding was intended to keep Zika vaccine research going despite the lack of funding from U.S. lawmakers, who left for summer recess before allocating any funding to Zika research and preparedness. The mosquito-borne Zika virus has spread to more than 50 countries and territories since the outbreak began last year in Brazil. On Thursday, Governor Rick Scott said state health officials have identified three additional people in the affected area with locally transmitted Zika, bringing the total to 25. The Obama administration in February requested $1.9 billion to fight Zika, but congressional lawmakers have been considering a much smaller sum. A bill providing $1.1 billion was blocked by Democrats after Republicans attached language to stop abortion-provider Planned Parenthood from using that government funding for healthcare services, mainly in U.S. territories like Puerto Rico. The Republican legislation also would siphon off unused money under President Barack Obama���������s signature 2010 healthcare law to combat Zika. In addition, Democrats balked at a Republican provision that they said would gut clean water protections. The new bolus of funds from HHS comes on top of the $589 million in repurposed funds previously allocated for Ebola efforts. HHS has said these funds will run out at the end of August. At a press briefing in Washington, Dr. Anthony Fauci,  director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he needs $33 million to prepare to move the first potential Zika vaccine to the second phase of human clinical trials. The first phase of that testing is expected to end in late November or December. Fauci said the health secretary has the authority to transfer 1 percent of NIH���������s $33 billion budget per year from one Institute to the other. He said the director of the NIH, Dr. Francis Collins, will decide which existing programs the funds will be drawn from. ���������He will probably do it on a prorated basis across the Institutes,��������� he said. Fauci said the budget transfer will not fill the longer-term NIH funding needs to fight the virus and to develop a second or third potential vaccine candidate.

"(Reuters) - A proposal to raise California���������s minimum wage to $15 an hour by the year 2021 has qualified to be listed on the upcoming November ballot in the state, officials said on Tuesday. The development comes as a wave of minimum wage increases at the state level sweeps the United States as the federal minimum wage has gone more than six years without an increase from $7.25 an hour. The California Secretary of State���������s office said supporters of the measure, pushed by Labor group coalition Lift Up California, had gathered more than the 400,000 signatures needed to have the Fair Wage Act of 2016 placed on the ballot. ���������California has led the country on environmental, health and civil rights protections and it���������s only appropriate that we would become the first state to enact a minimum wage that allows millions of families to live in dignity,��������� Los Angeles County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl said in a statement.  She added that the measure would build on the efforts of Los Angeles lawmakers, who last year passed a law hiking the city���������s minimum wage to $15 by 2020. The measure would boost the state���������s minimum wage to $11 an hour in 2017, and increase it by a dollar an hour every year until reaching $15 an hour in 2021. After 2021, the minimum wage would be adjusted annually based on the rate of inflation. The California Chamber of Commerce said earlier this month that it would oppose any state-wide ballot initiatives for a $15 minimum wage, arguing that it would create new costs for state and local governments as well as businesses. A Field Poll published last August showed that about seven out of 10 respondents favored the measure, with nearly half saying they strongly favored it. Fourteen states and several cities began the new year with increases to their minimum wage. California and Massachusetts saw some of the biggest hikes among the states, both increasing from $9 to $10 an hour, according to an analysis by the National Conference of State Legislatures.

"TORONTO (Reuters) - A Canadian pastor whom North Korea released this month after two years of imprisonment escaped execution and torture during his captivity because of his nationality, he told CBC News in his first interview since his return. Hyeon Soo Lim, the pastor from Toronto, said in an interview broadcast on Saturday that he was never harmed and that he would not hesitate to go back to North Korea if the country allowed him. A transcript of the interview was posted on the Canadian public broadcaster s website.  If I m just Korean, maybe they kill me,  Lim said.  I m Canadian so they cannot, because they cannot kill the foreigners.   Lim, formerly the senior pastor at one of Canada s largest churches, had disappeared on a mission to North Korea in early 2015. He was sentenced to hard labor for life in December 2015 on charges of attempting to overthrow the Pyongyang regime. He said North Korea treated him well despite forcing him to dig holes and break coal by hand all day in a labor camp. Lim told CBC News that he was  coached and coerced  into confessing that he traveled under the guise of humanitarian work as part of a  subversive plot  to overthrow the government and set up a religious state. North Korea let him go on humanitarian grounds. The announcement came during heightened tensions between Washington and Pyongyang, although authorities have not said there was any connection between his release and efforts to defuse the standoff over North Korea s nuclear program. Lim said he felt no anger at the Kim Jong Un regime for sentencing him to prison.  No, I thanked North Korea,  he said.  I forgive them.   ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland s president and its ruling party have reached a compromise on judicial reform, a parliamentary deputy said on Friday, bringing them closer to resolving an issue that has kept them at odds for more than three months. The government and President Andrzej Duda have been negotiating since July, when Duda unexpectedly vetoed legislation backed by the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party to overhaul the Polish court system.  We ve reached a preliminary agreement ... I hope that in late November we could discuss the project in  parliament,  PiS parliamentary deputy and negotiator Stanislaw Piotrowicz said on Friday. The proposals vetoed by Duda would have immediately removed all current Supreme Court judges unless they had the approval of the justice minister. Parliament would have gained the right to name most of the National Council of the Judiciary, which would nominate future candidates to preside over the Supreme Court. By giving parliament effective control over appointing - and sacking - senior judges, the proposals raised alarms in the rest of the European Union, of which Poland is a member. The EU said they undermined the independence of the courts and threatened the rule of law. The proposed compromise would still give parliament the right to name members of the National Council of the Judiciary, but that would require a three-fifths majority in the lower house of parliament, Piotrowicz said. Opposition parties would gain the right to propose judges, too. If candidates failed to gain approval, they could be chosen by a simple majority, he said. The PiS says the judicial system needs to be reformed because the courts are slow, inefficient and steeped in a communist-era mentality.  Duda s veto of parts of the reforms and his proposed limits on its authority over the court system created a stalemate that could have stalled the party s plans to reform not just the courts but the media and the electorate system as well. The compromise announced today still needs to be approved by the president and the leadership of PiS. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"(Reuters) - Michigan Governor Rick Snyder denied Thursday that he had misled a U.S. House of Representatives committee last year over testimony on Flint���������s water crisis after lawmakers asked if his testimony had been contradicted by a witness in a court hearing. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee wrote Snyder earlier Thursday asking him about published reports that one of his aides, Harvey Hollins, testified in a court hearing last week in Michigan that he had notified Snyder of an outbreak of Legionnaires��������� disease linked to the Flint water crisis in December 2015, rather than 2016 as Snyder had testified. ���������My testimony was truthful and I stand by it,��������� Snyder told the committee in a letter, adding that his office has provided tens of thousands of pages of records to the committee and would continue to cooperate fully.  Last week, prosecutors in Michigan said Dr. Eden Wells, the state���������s chief medical executive who already faced lesser charges, would become the sixth current or former official to face involuntary manslaughter charges in connection with the crisis. The charges stem from more than 80 cases of Legionnaires��������� disease and at least 12 deaths that were believed to be linked to the water in Flint after the city switched its source from Lake Huron to the Flint River in April 2014. Wells was among six current and former Michigan and Flint officials charged in June. The other five, including Michigan Health and Human Services Director Nick Lyon, were charged at the time with involuntary manslaughter stemming from their roles in handling the crisis. The crisis in Flint erupted in 2015 when tests found high amounts of lead in blood samples taken from children in the predominantly black city of about 100,000. The more corrosive river water caused lead to leach from pipes and into the drinking water. Lead levels in Flint���������s drinking water have since fallen below levels considered dangerous by federal regulators, state officials have said. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh is in negotiations with Myanmar aimed at a deal to repatriate displaced Rohingya and Dhaka s foreign minister will address the matter at talks in Myanmar this week, the Bangladeshi foreign ministry said on Sunday. More than 600,000 Muslim Rohingya have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since late August, driven out by a military clearance operation in Buddhist majority Myanmar s Rakhine State. The Rohingyas  suffering has caused an international outcry.  Bangladesh and Myanmar are in the process of negotiation for a bilateral agreement for repatriation of displaced people and expect to form a Joint Working Group to facilitate the repatriation,  said a ministry statement, quoting remarks by Foreign Minister Abul Hasan Mahmood Ali at a meeting with his Japanese counterpart in Dhaka on Sunday. A senior aide to Ali said he would leave for Myanmar late on Sunday to attend an Asia-Europe (ASEM) meeting on Monday and Tuesday and would stay on another couple of days for bilateral talks on the Rohingya. The official said Ali hoped for an agreement on allowing Rohingya to return to Myanmar.  Both countries have almost reached an understanding on this issue and there are a few points (still) to be agreed ... We hope to reach an agreement.  There was no immediate comment from Myanmar. On Nov. 1,  Myanmar insisted it was ready to set up a repatriation process but voiced fears Bangladesh was delaying an accord to first get international aid money. A senior Bangladesh home ministry official described the accusation as outrageous. Stung by international criticism and accusations of ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, Myanmar s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has said Rohingyas who can prove they were resident in Myanmar would be accepted back. Last week a United Nations General Assembly committee called on Myanmar to end military operations that have  led to the systematic violation and abuse of human rights  of Rohingya. The move revived a U.N. resolution that was dropped last year due to Myanmar s progress on human rights. However, in the past three months there has been a Rohingya exodus to Bangladesh after the Myanmar military began an operation against Rohingya militants who attacked 30 security posts and an army base in Rakhine on Aug. 25. Myanmar s army released a report on Monday denying all allegations of rapes and killings by security forces, days after replacing the general in charge of the military operation. Top U.N. officials have denounced the violence as a classic example of ethnic cleansing. The Myanmar government has denied these allegations. Rohingyas have been denied citizenship in Myanmar, where many Buddhists see them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. A U.S. congressional delegation, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and the foreign ministers of Germany, Sweden and Japan visited Rohingya camps in Cox s Bazar at the weekend to raise awareness of their plight.  We support Bangladesh s efforts toward a lasting solution, including the repatriation of displaced persons,  Japan s Taro Kona told Ali at their meeting, where Tokyo pledged $18.6 million in aid to ease the Rohingya crisis. Mogherini told reporters:  More than putting pressure, our approach has always been and will continue to be to offer a negotiating space, encourage the taking care of a situation that is not going to disappear.

"ISTRA, Russia (Reuters) - Russia���������s ban on imported foodstuffs from the West may have caused a headache for European farmers, but it has played right into the hands of Russian cheese producers gladly filling the lucrative niche. At a cheese fair held some 65 km (41 miles) outside Moscow last weekend, Russian versions of cheddar and feta vied for a spot on counters filled with Russian-made interpretations of brie, camembert and mature blue cheeses. ���������An industry is being born right in front of our eyes. Many (farmers) started making cheese in saucepans three years ago, just like us,��������� Oleg Sirota, an IT specialist turned cheese maker, and a one of the organizers of the fair, told Reuters Television. ���������We made our first cheese in a saucepan. Then we bought equipment produced in Russia. And now we are expecting new big vats made in Russia. ���������We are very proud that we not only make cheese, but we make it using Russian equipment and machinery,��������� Sirota added. Three years ago Russia���������s government banned some Western foodstuffs, including most dairy products, in response to Western sanctions imposed on Moscow for its role in the Ukraine crisis.  The cheese festival, in a nod of gratitude to the positive impact of the Russian food embargo, was entitled ���������Three years of sanctions!��������� Some food connoisseurs say the Russian cheeses are a poor substitute for their European equivalents, but people at the fair seemed impressed. ���������All the types of cheese are delicious, they are very similar to the French ones, the Italian ones,��������� said Anna, a visitor to the fair. ���������So there are a lot of equivalents which are no worse than the ones I tasted abroad.��������� The Russian food embargo comes at a price, however. Official statistics show that food prices have increased 1.5 times in the last three years after Russia banned imports of many European foodstuffs.   ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"DUBAI (Reuters) - A Saudi cleric who said women should not drive because their brains shrink to a quarter the size of a man s when they go shopping has been banned from preaching, state television said. Saad al-Hijri was suspended from all religious activity after advising against allowing women to drive in a speech that contained comments  diminishing human value , the broadcaster quoted a spokesman for the governor of Asir province as saying. Ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world that bans women from driving, despite ambitious government targets to increase their public role, especially in the workforce. Women in the kingdom are also bound by law to wear long robes and a headscarf and require the consent of a male guardian for most legal actions. In a video identifying him as the head of the religious edicts department in the southern province, Hijri asked what the traffic department would do it if it discovered a man with only half a brain.  Would it give him a license or not? It would not. So how can it give it to a woman when she has only half?  he said.  If she goes to the market she loses another half. What is left? A quarter...We demand the traffic department check because she is not suitable to drive and she has only a quarter.  The comments sparked anger on social media, which is hugely popular in the kingdom. Twitter users shared the video, many criticising it and making jokes about his remarks, under the Arabic hashtag  Al-Hijri_women_quarter_brain  Some users posted pictures of Saudi female scientists and academics in response and questioned Hijri s own intellectual capacities. His suspension, ordered by the provincial governor, was aimed at preventing the spread of views that spark controversy and do not serve the national interest, the provincial spokesman said, according to Ekhbariya TV s official Twitter account. Any others who used religious platforms to preach such views would also be banned. The government s modernizing reforms, backed by Saudi Arabia s business class, have sparked tensions with influential clerics upon whose support the ruling family relies. Some clerics have millions of followers on social media. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is likely to rescind an Obama-era policy that protects nearly 600,000 immigrants who entered the country illegally as children and are known as ���������Dreamers,��������� according to media reports on Friday. Trump���������s decision on whether to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, policy could be announced as early as next week, reported ABC News, citing multiple sources. Attorney General Jeff Sessions discussed the program with senior White House officials on Thursday, according to an administration official. Department of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan denied reports that the department had made any recommendations on DACA to the White House. ���������There have been continuing discussions about DACA but nothing has been determined,��������� Lapan told Reuters. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters on Friday that the program continues to be under review. A White House spokesperson told Reuters that only Congress can legislate a permanent solution for the plight of children who are currently protected from deportation by DACA. Trump had pledged on the election campaign trail to scrap all of former President Barack Obama���������s executive orders on immigration, including DACA. Immigrant advocates reacted to the news with a flurry of statements, promising to defend the program with protest and legal action. ���������Immigrant youth fought to create the DACA program and we will fight like hell to defend it,��������� said Greisa Martinez Rosas, Advocacy Director and DACA-beneficiary of United We Dream said in a statement. Civil rights groups said ending the program could increase racial divisions in the country in the wake of the recent violence in Charlottesville. Ten Republican state attorneys general in June urged the Trump administration to rescind the DACA program, while noting that the government did not have to revoke permits that had already been issued. If the federal government did not withdraw DACA by Sept. 5, the attorneys general said they would file a legal challenge to the program in a Texas federal court. The 10 who signed the letter represent Alabama, Arkansas,  Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. A larger coalition of 26 Republican attorneys general had challenged the Obama-era policy covering illegal immigrant parents, known as DAPA, that had been blocked by the courts before it took effect. The Department of Homeland Security rescinded that policy earlier this year. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Banking Committee���������s top Democrat tussled with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin during a hearing on Thursday over the flow of information from his agency, and later asked if President Donald Trump, a Republican, had ordered him to restrain communications with Democrats. ���������Are you aware of any White House guidance formal or informal urging administration officials not to respond to or to delay in responding to Democratic senators?��������� Senator Sherrod Brown, a liberal Democrat, asked Mnuchin toward the end of the hearing. ���������I am not,��������� Mnuchin answered. Brown said earlier in the hearing that he had written to Mnuchin on March 2 asking about ���������potential conflicts of interest and ownership in the administration,��������� but did not receive a response. He then pressed Mnuchin to send the committee ���������a complete list of Trump business associates and financial ties.���������  Mnuchin said that before the hearing he had checked that Treasury staff ���������had fully responded to all the inquiries from you and the committee��������� and asked Brown to send a note reminding him to deliver the list. While other senators began questioning Mnuchin, the two took the argument off-line, with Treasury emailing reporters a brief statement saying that it had responded to Brown���������s letter on March 31. Brown���������s office then circulated the response it had received, which generally discussed compliance with conflict of interest laws and lacked any details. Brown���������s office said Treasury���������s brief letter had not answered his questions. The senator also did not seem reassured that Treasury was not dragging its feet in communicating with Democrats. After he asked about possible guidance from the White House, Brown pressed: ���������Will you commit to responding to...members of both parties of this committee in a timely manner to all requests for information?��������� ���������I will,��������� Mnuchin responded.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump endorsed U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore on Monday, throwing his weight behind the embattled Alabama Republican before a special election next week that has been rocked by allegations of sexual misconduct against Moore. The White House said Trump endorsed the campaign in a call to Moore. In a post on Twitter, the president said Republicans needed the former Alabama Supreme Court justice to win to secure votes on key issues such as taxes and immigration. ���������Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama,��������� Trump wrote.  Moore thanked the president for his backing. ���������I look forward to fighting alongside the President to #MAGA!��������� Moore said on Twitter, using Trump���������s hashtag for his slogan ���������Make America Great Again.��������� In his tweet, Moore quoted Trump as saying, ���������Go get ���������em, Roy!��������� Trump had supported Moore���������s rival, U.S. Senator Luther Strange, in the Republican primary in September, in line with Senate Republicans.  He has slammed the Democratic candidate, former U.S. Attorney Doug Jones, as soft on crime and a potential puppet for Democratic leaders in Congress. On Monday, Trump said having a Democrat win the Dec. 12 election ���������would hurt our great Republican Agenda.���������  The White House has said Trump would not campaign for Moore but he is scheduled to hold a rally on Friday in Pensacola, Florida, adjacent to Alabama.  The Alabama Republican Party also has backed Moore even as  some Republicans in Congress have remained distant given the sexual misconduct allegations that surfaced last month. Moore has denied the allegations.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell last month said he believed Moore���������s accusers and joined other senators in urging him to quit the race. But on Sunday McConnell said it was up to Alabama voters to decide whether to send Moore to Washington. ���������I���������d have a real hard time voting for Roy Moore,��������� Republican U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz told CNN, calling the allegations against him very serious. But Alabama voters ���������very well may hold their nose and vote for��������� him rather than a Democrat.  Moore led Jones by six percentage points in a CBS News poll on Sunday, with most Alabama Republicans saying the allegations against him are false. A Washington Post poll last week showed Moore ahead by three percentage points, a lead within the survey���������s 4.5 point margin of error.  Several women have accused Moore of sexual assault or misconduct when they were teenagers and Moore was in his early 30s. Reuters has not independently verified the reports.

"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish court has freed on bail a British citizen facing charges of joining a terrorist organization, Turkey s Ihlas news agency said on Friday.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Corruption charges against a union leader and a financier������stemming from state and federal investigations that include an examination of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio���������s campaign fundraising practices are casting a cloud over his office and could possibly complicate his re-election bid. The arrests on Wednesday of the head of New York City���������s prison guard union and a hedge fund financier accused of orchestrating a bribery scheme involving union retirement and operating funds were the first to emerge from the probes. Although the charges were not linked to de Blasio, who won a landslide victory in 2013, the case is the first major prosecution to emerge from several overlapping state and federal corruption probes examining de Blasio���������s fundraising practices, among other avenues of inquiry.  David Birdsell, dean of the Baruch College School of Public Affairs, said on Wednesday the investigations were ���������keeping him off message,��������� noting that de Blasio was on occasion having to avoid the press because of incessant questions. On Wednesday his office said the investigations were not distracting the mayor. ���������New Yorkers will vote for the candidate who gets things done for their families and communities,��������� said Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for de Blasio. ���������That person is Mayor de Blasio.��������� Still, there is evidence that the investigations are affecting the mayor���������s standing, Birdsell said.  If they drag on and raise more questions they will not only be a distraction for the mayor but possibly encourage a challenge from his own party.  ���������Right now people smell some blood in the water,��������� Birdsell said. He said if the mayor becomes directly implicated in the investigations it would turn a contested Democratic primary mayoral race next year into a certainty from a likelihood. On Wednesday at a public appearance, de Blasio reiterated that he was ���������absolutely comfortable that we have done things properly.��������� He has said his administration committed no wrongdoing and is cooperating fully with investigators. In April, de Blasio���������s office received subpoenas from state and federal prosecutors pursuing coordinated corruption probes that extended from City Hall to the police department. News of the subpoenas came days after a leaked January report from the state Board of Elections accusing the mayor and others of intentionally evading campaign finance contribution limits in 2014. The mayor���������s counsel said at the time de Blasio had not been personally served. The once popular de Blasio, who struck a cord with New Yorkers after 12 years of Michael Bloomberg���������s mayoralty, has seen his approval rating fall to a new low in May, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.  De Blasio will be up for re-election in 2017. The latest poll, conducted in the first week of June among 600 likely Democratic mayoral primary voters and published on Wednesday, showed 38 percent believed de Blasio deserved reelection while 43 percent said he did not.������  The poll was conducted by NYC Deserves Better, a group formed by Bradley Tusk, a businessman and former campaign manager for Michael Bloomberg who wants a new mayor to be elected. The poll found that in a potential match up, de Blasio was neck-and-neck with City Comptroller Scott Stringer.������������  However, the poll also found that 51 percent had a ���������very positive��������� or ���������somewhat positive��������� opinion of the mayor, and 32 percent had a ���������somewhat negative��������� or ���������very negative��������� opinion. De Blasio brushed off questions about the poll and said he was committed to focusing on the job.  ���������Polls come and go. They go up. They go down. They don���������t always reflect what happens in elections,��������� he said. ���������I believe fundamentally that the goal is to do the work, do it well ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia s upper house Senate on Wednesday passed a measure to legalize same-sex marriage, perhaps as soon as next week, after lawmakers dismissed a conservative push to allow religious objectors to refuse service to same-sex couples. Australians overwhelmingly endorsed legalizing same-sex marriage in a postal survey run by the national statistics agency and the bill easily passed the Senate by 43 votes to 12. Conservative lawmakers had pressed for broad protections for religious objectors, among them florists, bakers and musicians, to refuse service to same-sex couples. But amendments for lay celebrants to refuse to solemnize same-sex marriages and permitting caterers opposed to the unions to refuse service at wedding receptions were either defeated or abandoned during two days of debate in the senate, where same-sex marriage supporters are in the majority.  The Australian people voted to lessen discrimination, not to extend it and we, the senate, have respected that vote by rejecting amendments which sought to extend discrimination, or derail marriage equality,  Labor Senator Penny Wong, who voted down all the amendments, told Parliament. The bill moves to the lower house next week, where conservative lawmakers hope for a renewed push to add measures exempting objectors to same-sex marriage from existing laws against discrimination.  I do not think we have made these changes in a way which advances rights fully,  said center-right National Party Senator Matt Canavan. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull s Liberal-National coalition government and the main opposition Labor Party have said they wanted to pass the law through parliament by Dec. 7.    If the legislation passes as expected, Australia will become the 26th nation to legalize same-sex marriage, a watershed for a country where some states held homosexual activity illegal until 1997.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House voted on Tuesday 215-205 to repeal regulations requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers��������� privacy than websites like Alphabet Inc���������s Google or Facebook Inc. The White House said earlier Tuesday that President Donald Trump strongly supports the repeal of the rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission in October under then-President Barack Obama. Under the rules, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children���������s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. Last week, the Senate voted 50-48 to reverse the rules in a win for AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. The White House in its statement said internet providers would need to obtain affirmative ���������opt-in��������� consent from consumers to use and share certain information, but noted that websites are not required to get the same consent. ���������This results in rules that apply very different regulatory regimes based on the identity of the online actor,��������� the White House said. Websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the Federal Trade Commission. FCC chairman Ajit Pai in a statement praised the decision of  Congress to overturn ���������privacy regulations designed to benefit one group of favored companies over another group of disfavored companies.��������� Last week, Pai said consumers would have privacy protections even without the Obama internet provider rules, but critics say they will weaker. The American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes the measure, said companies ���������should not be able to use and sell the sensitive data they collect from you without your permission.��������� An Internet & Television Association statement called the repeal ���������an important step toward restoring consumer privacy protections that apply consistently.��������� One critic of the repeal, Craig Aaron, president of Free Press advocacy group, said major Silicon Valley companies shied away from the fight over the rules because they profit from consumer data. ���������There are a lot of companies that are very concerned about drawing attention to themselves and being regulated on privacy issues, and are sitting this out in a way that they haven���������t sat out previous privacy issues,��������� Aaron said.  Representative Michael Capuano, a Massachusetts Democrat, said Tuesday that Comcast could know his personal information because he looked up his mother���������s medical condition and his purchase history. ���������Just last week I bought underwear on the internet. Why should you know what size I take? Or the color?��������� Capuano asked. ���������They are going to sell it to the underwear companies.��������� Comcast declined to comment. Representative Michael Burgess, a Texas Republican, said the rules ���������unfairly skews the market in favor��������� of websites that are free to collect data without consent. Republican commissioners, including Pai, said in October that the rules would unfairly give websites like Facebook, Twitter Inc or Google the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers and thus further dominate digital advertising. The FCC earlier this month delayed the data rules from taking effect. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"(Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Tuesday proposed overhauling the state���������s education funding formula to provide all public school districts with a flat rate of $6,599 per student. Calling it his ���������Fairness Formula��������� in policy statements on Tuesday, Christie said aid for special needs students would continue even with any potential formula change. Schools are funded through property taxes, which in New Jersey are some of the highest in the nation because of the state���������s ���������unaffordable and broken school funding formula propped up by special interests and misguided Supreme Court precedent,��������� Christie said in a statement. He said he would traverse the state this summer to talk about the proposal. The amount of state aid school districts receive now varies widely, with some getting less than $3,000 per pupil and others getting as much as $28,000 Such a change would be an uphill battle, as it would need approval from a Democrat-led legislature that has already rejected previous education formula changes from Christie, a Republican. ���������Governor Christie���������s idea is unconstitutional and harmful to our most vulnerable children,��������� Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that Christie still hasn���������t fully funded schools under the existing formula. Currently, poorer districts receive more state aid under a formula based on a 1990 New Jersey Supreme Court decision called     Abbott v. Burke II, which ruled the state���������s education funding was unfair and that low-income ���������Abbott districts��������� must be funded on par with wealthier ones.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Democrats on Thursday demanded that Attorney General Jeff Sessions be recalled to testify on the Trump campaign���������s Russia contacts after the disclosure of an effort to set up a meeting between then-Republican candidate Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Judiciary Committee Democrats want to question Sessions, who was the Trump campaign���������s chief foreign policy adviser, about his denials that he knew anything about contacts between the campaign and Russians or Russian government intermediaries. Sessions ���������needs to come back before the committee, in person, under oath, to explain why he cannot seem to provide truthful, complete answers,��������� Senator Patrick Leahy, the panel���������s senior Democrat, said in a statement. Two other Democrats supported Leahy���������s call ���������Attorney General Sessions should come back before Congress and answer questions in light of recent revelations,��������� said Senator Ron Wyden. In an eight-page letter to Sessions on Thursday, Senator Al Franken recalled that the attorney general said at an Oct. 18 Judiciary Committee hearing that a continuing exchange between the Trump campaign and Russian government intermediaries ���������did not happen, at least not to my knowledge and not with me.��������� Sessions, Franken wrote, ���������apparently failed to tell the truth under oath.���������     According to court documents filed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller that were unsealed on Monday, George Papadopoulos, a minor Trump campaign adviser, said at a March 31, 2016, meeting of Trump foreign policy advisers ���������that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President Putin.���������     A photograph posted on Trump���������s Instagram account shows Papadopoulos sitting two seats from Sessions at the meeting, which Trump also attended. A New York Times report on Tuesday quoted a participant as saying that Sessions ���������shut George down,��������� ruled there should be no meeting with Putin and ordered those present ���������not to speak about this again.���������     However, CNN reported on Thursday that John Cornyn, the second-ranking Senate Republican, who serves on the intelligence and judiciary committees, said that he had been unaware that Sessions was at the meeting. ���������I certainly think it���������s a legitimate area of inquiry��������� for congressional investigators to pursue, Cornyn told CNN. CNN also reported that Carter Page, another former Trump campaign adviser, told the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday that he had informed Sessions of an upcoming July 2016 trip to Russia. Page said the trip was unrelated to his work for the Trump campaign, CNN said. Democratic sources who requested anonymity said Republican Chuck Grassley, the committee chairman, is resisting the Democrats��������� demands to recall Sessions. Instead, he is suggesting that the attorney general be allowed to submit updated written testimony, they said. A spokesman for Grassley did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment, and Trump denies any collusion. Russia has denied three U.S. intelligence agencies��������� conclusion in January that Moscow tried to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.     ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"(Reuters) - Protesters for and against Trump faced off in a plaza a few blocks from the site of the Republican National Convention in downtown Cleveland on Monday, shouting slogans at each other but avoiding physical confrontation.  Dozens of protesters were separated by a wall of police that looked equal in number.  To one side of the police line at the foot of the Key Tower, Cleveland���������s tallest building, demonstrators shouted, ���������Black Lives Matter.��������� From the other side came, ���������You���������re a bunch of anarchists.��������� The exchanges marked the first emotionally charged demonstration at the 2016 Republican National Convention, where security forces are on alert for potentially disruptive conflicts.  A combination of intense rhetoric by presumptive Republican candidate Donald J. Trump, recent police shootings of African- Americans in Baton Rouge and the Minneapolis area, and the killings of police in Dallas and Baton Rouge has raised tensions in the run-up to the convention.  Alicia Street, 31, a Black Lives Matter activist from Ferguson, Missouri, told Reuters that police appeared to outnumber the protesters. ���������We don���������t need all these police. This is just free speech,��������� Street said shortly after a group of pro-Trump protesters left the area. ���������They are going to make people afraid.��������� Smaller demonstrations were held elsewhere in the downtown area. At least two protesters were seen carrying firearms. A  group of people identifying themselves as ���������anti-gay Christians��������� shouted at a rival group. One person carried a sign that read, ���������Stop being a sinner and obey Jesus.��������� A speaker at an anti-Trump rally was arrested, but police said it was unrelated to the campaign. One protest leader, Kait McIntyre, 27, said organizers from her group had sought permission for weeks to march outside the protest zone and only recently received it from the city.  ���������We wanted to get within sight and sound of the actual convention. We wanted our voices heard,��������� she said. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"BEIJING (Reuters) - China urged France on Monday to take more effective measures to ensure the safety of its nationals visiting the country, after a group of 40 Chinese tourists was tear-gassed and robbed in Paris. Attacks on Chinese, Japanese and Korean tourists are relatively frequent in the French capital, as robbers believe they carry large sums in cash and their luggage is stuffed with expensive products. Four men targeted the Chinese travelers in the parking lot of their hotel in the Val-de-Marne suburb southeast of Paris on Thursday, on their return from a city tour, the state-run Xinhua news agency said, citing French media. The assailants stole nine bags thought to be filled with luxury goods, it said on Sunday. China s embassy in France had contacted police and told them to  crack the case , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a news briefing, adding that Chinese visitors should be alert to the security situation.  We will urge French police to crack this case as soon as they can and bring the criminals to justice, and take even more effective measures to ensure the safety of Chinese citizens in France,  Hua said. She said the tour group had already returned to China, and the case was still being investigated. In August 2016, 27 Chinese tourists were assaulted by six men who boarded a bus that was to take them to Paris  Charles de Gaulle airport. Paris is on track this year to welcome more tourists than ever before, the city s tourist board said in August, a recovery from a lull following Islamist attacks in November 2015 that killed 130 people. Chinese travelers spent $261 billion overseas last year, making them a key demographic for retailers and hotel chains around the world. But growth in Chinese outbound tourism is slowing, with attacks in Europe, instability on the Korean peninsula and political uncertainty in the United States prompting some Chinese to opt instead for domestic trips.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump s expected move to  de-certify  the international nuclear deal with Iran is driving a wedge between Europe and the United States and bringing Europeans closer to Russia and China, Germany said on Thursday. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has spoken out repeatedly against Trump s likely step, but his latest comments aimed to spell out the impact it would have in starker terms.  It s imperative that Europe sticks together on this issue,  Gabriel, a Social Democrat, told the RND German newspaper group.  We also have to tell the Americans that their behavior on the Iran issue will drive us Europeans into a common position with Russia and China against the USA.  Trump is seen unveiling a broad strategy on confronting Iran this week, likely on Friday, including a move to de-certify Iran s compliance with the 2015 accord, which he has called an  embarrassment  and the  worst deal ever negotiated.   Senior U.S. officials, European allies and prominent U.S. lawmakers have told Trump that refusing to certify the deal would leave the U.S. isolated, concede the diplomatic high ground to Tehran, and ultimately risk the unraveling of the agreement. The U.N. nuclear watchdog has repeatedly certified that Iran is adhering to restrictions on its nuclear energy program mandated by the deal to help ensure it cannot be put to developing atomic bombs. Signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, the deal lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear work. Germany has close economic and business ties with Russia, although relations have soured since Moscow s annexation of Ukraine s Crimea region. Berlin is also working to expand ties with China. Gabriel is expected to leave his post in coming months since his Social Democrats have vowed to go into opposition after slumping badly in the Sept. 24 election, opting not to reprise an awkward  grand coalition  with Merkel s conservatives.  Gabriel on Monday urged the White House not to jeopardize the nuclear agreement, saying such a move would worsen instability in the Middle East and could make it more difficult to halt nuclear arms programs in other countries. In the interview released on Thursday, he said the nuclear agreement was being treated  like a football  in U.S. domestic politics, but the issue could have serious consequences. He said Russia was watching developments closely, including the divisions between Europe and the United States.  That doesn t exactly strengthen our position in Europe.  Ultimately, Gabriel told the newspaper group, there were only three countries - the United States, Russia and China - that could avert a new nuclear arms race.  But those countries mistrust each other so much at the moment that they are not working together sufficiently. It must be in our interest to press for more trust.  ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday accused the news media of ignoring attacks by Islamist militants in Europe. Trump, who has made defeating Islamic State a core goal of his presidency, did not specify which attacks were going unreported, which news media organizations were ignoring them, or offer any details to support his claims. ���������All over Europe, it���������s happening. It���������s gotten to a point where it���������s not even being reported,��������� he told a group of about 300 U.S. troops at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida. ���������And, in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn���������t want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that,��������� he added, without saying what those reasons were. The White House later released a list of 78 attacks around the world from September 2014 to December 2016. ���������Networks are not devoting to each of them the same level of coverage they once did,��������� a White House official said. ���������This cannot be allowed to become the ���������new normal.������������������It was Trump���������s latest salvo against the news media, a favorite target for derision that he says broadly underestimated his chances during the presidential campaign. He has kept up the attacks since his Jan. 20 inauguration. Trump at one point cited attacks in the French cities of Paris and Nice, which were widely covered. More than 230 people have died in France alone in the past two years at the hands of attackers allied to Islamic State. Al Tompkins at The Poynter Institute, a Florida-based journalism school, dismissed Trump���������s criticism. ���������To suggest that journalists have some reason not to report ISIS attacks is just outlandish,��������� Tompkins said, using an acronym for Islamic State.

"(Reuters) - Highlights of the day for U.S. President Donald Trump���������s administration on Friday: Trump says he will make a massive budget request for one of the ���������greatest military buildups in American history��������� in a feisty, campaign-style speech extolling robust nationalism to eager conservative activists. Trump signs an executive order aimed at repealing or simplifying federal regulations. Trump criticizes the FBI for failing to stop leaks of national security information to the media and directs the agency to find those who pass on classified information. Russian politicians close to the Kremlin say Trump���������s declared aim of putting the U.S. nuclear arsenal ���������at the top of the pack��������� risks starting a new Cold War-style arms race between Washington and Moscow. China dismisses renewed pressure from Trump over its role in North Korea, saying the crux of the matter is a dispute between Washington and Pyongyang. China says it has no intention of using currency devaluation to its advantage in trade, responding to Trump���������s description of China as the ���������grand champions��������� of currency manipulation. Mexico does not need U.S. financial aid, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong says, after Trump ordered a report on such assistance given by the United States to its southern neighbor over the last five years. ANTI-TRUMP MOVEMENT Raucous town hall meetings held by Republican Congress members are the latest outburst in a relentless series of rallies, marches and protests that shows no signs of abating more than 30 days into the Trump administration. Germany does not yet have a full picture of the approach Trump���������s administration is taking on foreign, security and trade policy but is keen to engage with Washington on these issues, a Foreign Ministry spokesman says. Peru���������s Trade Minister Eduardo Ferreyros says he does not think Trump would want to renegotiate the trade agreement between the two countries because it has been beneficial to the United States.

"DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen s Houthi leader Abdel-Malek al-Houthi said on Thursday his group could target Saudi oil tankers should Saudi Arabia attack Yemen s main port at Hodeidah.   We could target Saudi oil tankers and we could do anything,  he said.  In a televised speech, the leader also said his group s ballistic missiles were capable of reaching the United Arab Emirates  capital of Abu Dhabi and anywhere inside Saudi Arabia.  It was unclear whether the Houthi group has the capability to carry out its threats. Abdel Malek said the Houthis had successfully fired a missile at Abu Dhabi earlier this month, meaning the United Arab Emirates was no longer safe from attack. He gave no further details and there has been no indication by the UAE of any missiles landing on their territory.  UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said on Twitter his country was not intimidated by Houthi threats.  The Houthis  comments threatening the UAE and its capital are tangible proof of the need for the Decisive Storm (operation),  Gargash said, referring to the Saudi-led coalition intervening in Yemen.  Iran s militias have vile objectives and represent a real threat,  he added. Yemen has been devastated by more than two years of civil war in which President Abd Rabu Hadi s government, backed by the coalition, is fighting to drive the Iran-allied Houthis out of cities they seized in 2014 and 2015 in a rapid rise to national power.  Today the port of Hodeidah is being threatened and we cannot turn a blind eye to that,  Abdel-Malek said.   If the Saudi regime and with a green light from the U.S. attack Hodeidah then we have to take steps that we haven t taken before.   The United Nations had proposed that the Red Sea port of Hodeidah, where 80 percent of food imports arrive, should be handed to a neutral party, to smooth the flow of humanitarian relief and prevent the port being engulfed by Yemen s two-year-old war. The government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi accuses the Houthis of using the port to smuggle in weapons and of collecting custom duties on goods, which they use to finance the war. The Houthis deny this. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (Reuters) - Emergency management officials across South Florida hastened disaster preparations on Tuesday in anticipation of Hurricane Irma s expected weekend arrival on the U.S. mainland with possibly greater force than Hurricane Harvey unleashed on Texas. Irma, a Category 5 storm - the highest hurricane ranking used by U.S. forecasters - neared the Caribbean s northern Leeward Islands, east of Puerto Rico, late on Tuesday with maximum sustained winds of 185 miles per hour (300 km/h). The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami forecast the storm would make landfall in Florida on Saturday, although Irma s precise trajectory remained to be seen. Forecasters described the storm as  potentially catastrophic.  Irma ranks as one of the five most powerful Atlantic hurricanes during the past 80 years and is the strongest Atlantic storm ever recorded outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, the NHC said. Mindful of the devastation wrought by Harvey days ago along the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana, Florida officials were taking no chances.   Normally, people here don t like to prepare,  said Gary Palmer, a 60-year-old deputy sheriff who visited a home supply store in Fort Lauderdale.  But what happened in Texas opened up everybody s eyes.  Authorities in the Florida Keys, the popular resort archipelago stretching from the southern tip of the state s mainland peninsula, called for a mandatory evacuation of the islands  visitors, starting at sunrise on Wednesday. Roman Gastesi, administrator of Monroe County, which includes the Keys, said a mandatory evacuation of residents there was likely at some point. Residents of low-lying areas in densely populated Miami-Dade County to the north were urged to move to higher ground by Wednesday as a precaution against coastal storm surges. Public schools throughout South Florida were to be closed ahead of the storm, starting with Monroe and neighboring Lee County on Wednesday and Miami-Dade and several others districts beginning on Thursday.  My wife is leaving the Keys today,  Monroe County Emergency Management Director Martin Senterfitt said in a statement.  She would rather go to the dentist than sit in traffic. The sooner people leave the better. If ever there was a storm to take serious in the Keys, this is it.  U.S. President Donald Trump, acting at the request of Governor Rick Scott, approved an emergency declaration on Tuesday mobilizing federal disaster relief efforts in Florida ahead of Irma s arrival, the White House said. Scott has also directed all 7,000 of the state s National Guard troops to report for duty Friday morning, saying additional Guard members would be activated as needed beforehand. Fort Lauderdale native Alexandra Nimmons, 25, said she was taking Irma s possible impact on South Florida more seriously after seeing the extreme damage Harvey left behind in Texas.  I spent a while today collecting water,  Nimmons said.  I hoard Mason and salsa jars so that finally paid off.  She also planned to stock up on candles, matches and canned food. Annisa Ali, 45, who just moved to Oakland Park, Florida, from New York City said she was having a hard time finding water at local stores.  Last night, I went to Wal-Mart. No water. I went to Target. No water. Now I m here. No water,  Ali said at a grocery store in Wilton Manors, Florida. James Foote, a 56-year-old handyman in Fort Lauderdale, said he was unable to find any plywood to nail over windows at a local home supply store on Tuesday. He said more wood was expected to be delivered on Wednesday.  I will be back tomorrow before this place opens at 7 o clock,  Foote said.  I ve waited in lines for concert tickets before.

"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Saad al-Hariri, who announced his resignation as Lebanese prime minister in a televised broadcast from Saudi Arabia on Nov. 4, will visit Egypt on Tuesday to meet Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Hariri s office said on Sunday. Hariri has since Saturday been in Paris, where he met French President Emmanuel Macron, and has said he will return to Lebanon by Wednesday for its Independence Day celebrations. Lebanese President Michel Aoun has said he will not accept Hariri s resignation until it is delivered in person and all sides in Beirut have called for his speedy return. A leader in Hariri s Future Movement had earlier told Reuters Hariri would visit Egypt on Monday. The resignation sparked a political crisis in Lebanon and put it on the front line of a regional power struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran.  Hariri criticized Iran and its ally Hezbollah, which is in Lebanon s coalition government, in his resignation statement, and said he feared assassination. Apart from a brief trip to Abu Dhabi, he remained in Saudi Arabia until he flew to France. His stay in the kingdom led to accusations from Lebanese officials and politicians that Saudi Arabia had coerced him to resign, which he and Riyadh denied.  On Friday, Hariri tweeted that his presence there was for  consultations on the future of the situation in Lebanon and its relations with the surrounding Arab region . On Sunday, Arab League foreign ministers held an emergency meeting in Cairo, requested by Saudi Arabia, to discuss ways to confront Iran and Hezbollah over their role in the region.  In a statement afterwards, the ministers accused Hezbollah of supporting terrorism in Arab countries.  Lebanese Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil did not attend. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A Swiss man was handed a suspended prison term of nearly two years and a fine on Thursday for spying on a German tax authority, in a case that has pitted Swiss bank secrecy against Germany s clampdown on tax evasion. The penalty was relatively modest as spying for a foreign state is punishable in Germany by up to five years in prison, but the Frankfurt court said the man, identified only as Daniel M., had no prior convictions and had made a full confession. Daniel M., 54, had tried to get the personal contact details of German tax officials for Swiss intelligence, which wanted to prosecute them for obtaining secret bank data. German states including the one in question, North Rhine-Westphalia, have over the past few years gotten hold of CDs containing details of bank accounts held secretly in Switzerland by Germans hoping to avoid tax. Swiss authorities say this amounts to the theft of business secrets, while German officials say they are combating illegal tax evasion. Lawyers for Daniel M., whose spying activities lasted from 2011 until 2015, had argued that their client was simply a  patriot  caught between two ideologies. The court, which handed him a suspended prison term of a year and 10 months and a fine of 40,000 euros ($46,392), acknowledged that he had suffered considerable financial damage since being detained in Frankfurt in May. But it also criticized his cooperation with Swiss intelligence over a period of at least two and a half years.  The depiction of the defendant s actions as those of a Swiss patriot did not convince the court, especially because tax evasion, the reason for the tax officials  actions, is not considered morally protected behavior in Switzerland either,  the court said in a statement. The Swiss Banking Act requires employees of Swiss-regulated banks to keep client information confidential, but a number of staff have leaked account details to foreign authorities in the past decade as Western governments crack down on tax evasion. Whistleblowers and new disclosure standards have proven costly for Swiss banks, which have suffered hundreds of billions of dollars in outflows as a result. Over a third of Swiss private banks have permanently closed.     ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

Halkbank has said all of its transactions complied with national and international regulations. According to local media reports, Zarrab also testified that he used Denizbank for some transactions.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans on Wednesday passed a bill in the House of Representatives that touched on nearly every step U.S. agencies take in creating and applying new rules, continuing their blitz to radically reform ���������abusive��������� federal regulation of areas from the environment to the workplace. In a 238-183 vote, the House passed the ���������Regulatory Accountability Act,��������� which combined eight bills aimed at changing how the vast government bureaucracy runs. Only five Democrats voted for it. The legislation would give President-elect Donald Trump tools ���������to wipe out abusive regulation,��������� said Bob Goodlatte, the Judiciary Committee chairman who is among the many House leaders calling for lighter regulation and saying the costs to comply with federal rules are too high. Republicans say there is little accountability for regulations that apply to almost every aspect of American life because they are created by appointed officials and not elected representatives. Federal agencies operate either independently or under the president���������s authority.  The current reform push is part of Trump���������s campaign promise to ���������drain the swamp,��������� House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Wednesday. As House Republicans push for reform - last week they passed bills requiring Congressional approval of major rules and giving Congress power to kill dozens of recently enacted ones - Democrats are fighting back. Democrats have said the many extra procedures required by the reform bills would stall agencies��������� work, making it impossible to create needed regulations on the environment, financial markets and other areas. Democrats contend that slowing down rulemaking is intended to help big businesses escape oversight. The accountability act would jeopardize the government���������s capability ���������to safeguard public health and safety, the environment, workplace safety and consumer financial protections,��������� the Judiciary Committee���������s senior Democrat, John Conyers, said before the vote.������  ���������Worse yet, many of these new requirements are intended to facilitate the ability of regulated entities - such as well-funded corporate interests - to intervene and derail regulatory protections they oppose,��������� Conyers said. Specifically, the bill would require agencies to post more detailed information on proposals for an extended period of time, limit judge���������s interpretations in legal challenges, and require agencies to enact the lowest-cost version of a rule.  The House is expected to vote on Thursday on changes to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the major securities and derivatives regulators.  Still, none of these bills may become law, as Democrats hold enough seats in the Senate to filibuster. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"KRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin on Thursday accused American politicians of whipping up hysteria about a mythical Russian threat as a ploy to distract voters from their own failings in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election. Putin, addressing an audience of foreign policy experts gathered in southern Russia, repeatedly lashed out at the Obama administration, saying it did not keep its word on Syria, did not honour deals, and had falsely accused Moscow of all manner of sins.     The U.S. government has formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organisations, while Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has accused Republican rival Donald Trump of being a Putin ���������puppet���������. Putin said he found it hard to believe that anyone seriously thought Moscow was capable of influencing the Nov. 8 election. ���������Hysteria has been whipped up,��������� said Putin.  He said that was a ruse to cover up for the fact that the U.S. political elite had nothing to say about serious issues such as the country���������s national debt or gun control. ���������It���������s much simpler to distract people with so-called Russian hackers, spies, and agents of influence. Does anyone really think that Russia could influence the American people���������s choice in any way? Is America a banana republic or what? America is a great power.��������� In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest dismissed Putin���������s remarks as predictable and said the United States stood by its hacking allegations.  ���������There���������s nothing that President Putin had to say today that I find particularly surprising or that in any way undermines the president���������s confidence in the analysis that���������s been released by the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence community,��������� said Earnest. Russian state TV and some of his past comments have suggested the Russian leader favours Trump, but Putin said he did not back any candidate in the U.S. election and was ready to work with any new U.S. president and to discuss any issue.  Asked about Trump, whom he once described as ���������very talented,��������� Putin said the Republican candidate was deliberately adopting a showy style because he wanted to get his message across and that he represented ordinary voters fed up with the U.S. political elite. ���������He has chosen a method to get through to voters��������� hearts,��������� said Putin. ���������He behaves extravagantly of course, we see this, but I think there���������s a reason for this.��������� Putin dismissed suggestions by some politicians in the West that Russia is poised to attack another country or intervene elsewhere in the Middle East apart from Syria.    Such talk was designed to exaggerate the threat that Russia posed, he said, in order for certain countries to secure higher military spending and talk up their own importance. He said Russia was not planning to attack anyone. But he made clear Russia was in Syria for the long haul and intended to clear the city of Aleppo of what he called ���������a nest of terrorists���������, while trying to minimise civilian casualties.

We have completely closed our air space to the regional government in northern Iraq,  the paper cited Erdogan as telling reporters on his plane returning from a trip to Poland.  Talks are continuing on what will be done regarding the land (border) ... We have not shut the border gates yet but this could happen too at any moment,  he added.

A Sept. 25 referendum, in which Kurds in northern Iraq voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence, alarmed Baghdad, Iraq s neighbors and Western powers, all of whom feared further regional conflict could arise from the vote. Subsequently Kurdish Peshmerga forces retreated to positions they held in northern Iraq in June 2014 in response to an Iraqi army advance into the region after the referendum, a senior Iraqi commander said on Wednesday.

"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday vowed to file an impeachment complaint against the head of the country s anti-graft body after she launched an inquiry into allegations that he has billions of pesos in undeclared funds in bank accounts. The firebrand leader said he also wanted the chief justice of the Supreme Court removed because she allowed herself to be used as a tool by his political opponents, who are conspiring to unseat him.  We will file an impeachment case against her,  Duterte told reporters, referring to Conchita Carpio-Morales, who heads the Office of the Ombudsman, the government s anti-graft agency.  I would tend to believe she was part of the conspiracy.  Duterte was angered when the agency confirmed last month it was examining allegations that he failed to disclose the full extent of his wealth in a mandatory asset declaration when he was mayor of a southern city prior to becoming president.   In the end, they will discover, to their sorrow, there is no such amount,  he said, challenging Carpio-Morales and Supreme Court Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno to join him in making public their own bank accounts and resigning from office. He said Sereno did not disclose government earnings of 30 million pesos ($588,000) for serving as a private lawyer in an airport arbitration case. Sereno already faces a pending impeachment case in Congress. Sereno made no immediate comment, but her lawyers said they were ready to answer the complaint and prove she had not committed an impeachable offense. An impeachment complaint against Carpio-Morales, who is the aunt of Duterte s son-in-law, would be based on accusations of  selective justice  and the use of  falsified documents , the president added.  Carpio-Morales  office did not respond to telephone calls from Reuters to seek comment. In an earlier statement, her office had said,  This office shall not be intimidated. We will nonetheless proceed with the probe as mandated by the constitution.      In the Philippines, the president, vice president, supreme court judges, heads of constitutional agencies and the ombudsman can only be removed through impeachment on the basis of high crimes such as treason, bribery, corruption, betrayal of public trust and constitutional violations. Duterte said the two women had conspired with members of the Liberal Party and with his critic, Senator Antonio Trillanes, who supplied the ombudsman with what he called illegally-acquired and stolen bank records. In an interview with reporters, Trillanes denied the president s latest allegations.  For me, Mr Duterte, do not avoid the issue of hidden wealth with this malicious allegation,  he added.

At a rally on Friday before thousands of cheering supporters in Pensacola, Florida, Trump had more harsh words for the Democratic presidential nominee in the fallout over their crossfire at a televised national security forum in New York on Wednesday. ���������Because she���������s being so protected, she could walk into this arena right now and shoot somebody with 20,000 people watching right smack in the middle of the heart and she wouldn���������t be prosecuted, okay?��������� he said. ���������That is what���������s happened to this country. I never thought I���������d see the day where this has happened to our country,��������� he added. Trump���������s charge is that Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state and former U.S. senator, has profited from a ���������rigged��������� political system. He has repeatedly denounced the FBI���������s decision not to prosecute Clinton for her use of a private email server and the handling of classified information.  As a newcomer to politics, Trump has used colorful language in the past to describe fervent support for him. ���������I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn���������t lose voters,��������� Trump said at a campaign rally in Iowa last January.

"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s parliament approved contentious taxes needed to finance a public sector pay rise on Monday and Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri warned the alternative was a collapse of the Lebanese pound in six months.  Without taxes it would have been better in popular terms, but six months later the lira would have collapsed,  Hariri said after the parliament session.   If we carried out the (public sector salary law) without revenues it would be a disaster for the country.   Lebanon has a debt-to-GDP ratio of 148 percent, one of the highest in the world, and recorded a fiscal deficit of $4.9 billion last year.   Parliament approved a $917 million rise in public sector salaries and a series of tax increases to fund it in July.  Despite objections from business and some political groups, President Michel Aoun ratified the laws in late August and people have since begun receiving increased salaries. But in September the constitutional council annulled the tax law after a political party brought a legal challenge and the council referred it back to parliament for amendments. A Lebanese official told Reuters the taxes approved on Monday remained  mostly as they were before being challenged in the Constitutional Council and do not contain any substantive amendments .  A key argument of those opposing increased taxes is that the Lebanese government offers little in return.    The country s infrastructure has been awaiting repair since the 15-year civil war ended in 1990 - roads are clogged with cars, beaches are littered with waste, internet links are slow or patchy and cuts to power and water supplies are frequent.    Sami Gemeyal, leader of the Christian Kataeb party which filed an appeal against the earlier version of the law, said it would do all it could to challenge it again.   We will study it and see if it is possible to contest the law at the constitutional council,  said Gemeyal. Kataeb is the only major political party not part of Lebanon s coalition government. Lebanon expects to hold a general election next year and the public sector pay rises have proved a popular move. But the business community has warned higher taxes could damage Lebanon s fragile economy, which has been battered by conflict in neighboring Syria. Growth fell from 8-9 percent to below 2 percent after war began in 2011. Business leaders say Lebanon instead needs better tax collection, a credible economic plan and a budget to be passed for the first time since 2005. The banking sector, the cornerstone of Lebanon s economy, objected strongly to the law.  The changes raised corporation tax to 17 percent from 15 percent and also applies taxes on bank transactions in a way bankers say amounts to double taxation.   The effective tax rate on banks currently stands at around 15 percent, but would rise to around 50 percent if the proposed tax changes are enacted, Freddie Baz, Group Strategy Director of Bank Audi and board member of the Association of Banks in Lebanon (ABL) lobby group, told Reuters.     The laws have provoked a number of street protests, with people asking for pay rises and also protesting hikes which raised value-added tax (VAT) by 1 percentage point to 11 percent. The head of Lebanon s General Labor Union Beshara al-Asmar said before the vote on Monday there would be a  complete strike  which would ground the country to a halt if positive results were not achieved.

" WASHINGTON (Reuters) - There was a moment in Sunday���������s U.S. presidential debate when Democrat Hillary Clinton was trying to fend off an attack from Republican rival Donald Trump about her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.  ���������It���������s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,��������� Clinton said of her rival for the Nov. 8 election.  ���������Because you���������d be in jail,��������� Trump shot back, drawing a mix of gasps and applause from the crowd that was defying instructions to remain silent.  It was one of the most explosive moments of the debate in St. Louis, and unprecedented for one presidential candidate to suggest on a debate stage that his opponent should be in jail.  The debate was crammed with moments that could at best be described as petty and at worse vicious - as the candidates traded personal attacks and sarcastic one-liners.  Trump frequently interrupted Clinton and sparred with the two debate moderators, who in turn chastised the crowd for occasional outbursts.  When moderator Anderson Cooper asked Clinton if Trump had the discipline to be a good leader, Clinton responded with one word: ���������No.���������  ���������I���������m shocked to hear that,��������� Trump responded sarcastically.  He called Clinton names, including referring to her as ���������the devil��������� when discussing the support for her by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, Clinton's rival for the Democratic presidential nomination.  ���������We have a divided nation, because people like her - and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart,��������� Trump said a few minutes later.  Clinton in turn jabbed at Trump for his lewd remarks about women captured on a 2005 videotape released on Friday that has thrown his candidacy into crisis.  ���������OK, Donald, I know you���������re into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it���������s exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you,��������� Clinton said.  After 90 minutes of such harsh exchanges, the mood changed suddenly when the final question came from an audience member who asked each candidate to describe one admirable quality about the other.  ���������I respect his children. His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald,��������� Clinton said.  Trump said of Clinton: ���������She doesn���������t quit, she doesn���������t give up, I respect that.���������  At the close of the debate, they shook hands, something they had notably avoided doing when the night started.

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Failure to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal would be a major setback for U.S. interests in Asia as Washington seeks to deepen alliances in the region, Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday, urging Congress to ratify the pact. The 12-nation Pan-Pacific trade deal championed by President Barack Obama has been pilloried by both major-party nominees in the U.S. presidential race, Democrat Hilary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. While Republicans have traditionally backed free trade deals, Trump has blamed them for U.S. job losses and threatened to rip them up or renegotiate them if he wins the Nov. 8 election.  ���������If we see the TPP rejected, it would be a gigantic self-inflicted wound ��������� a setback to our own interests in the region,��������� Kerry told the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, in remarks that drew a smattering of applause and boos. ���������It would amount to a conscious turning of our backs on the Asia Pacific at the very moment that we ought to be linking arms ��������� it would be an act that will hurt American workers, slow our economy, hinder our ability to advance the full range of U.S. objectives��������� in the fast-growing region, he added. Republican leaders have said there is no point in bringing the trade deal for a vote in the ���������lame-duck��������� session of Congress after the election.  But Kerry urged Congress to approve the deal after the election, saying: ���������It���������s the right thing to do for America ��������� and no matter what the loudest voices may be shouting ��������� it is also the popular choice.���������  There are concerns in Washington that failure to pass the TPP would prompt Southeast Asian nations to turn to China and Russia. Kerry said the trade deal was a ���������litmus��������� test of Washington���������s capacity to lead and was necessary if the United States wanted a steady and reliable presence in the region. His comments came amid tensions with China over the disputed South China Sea, increased concerns over North Korea���������s missile and nuclear weapons programs, and questions over the future of the U.S.-Philippines alliance.

"CARACAS (Reuters) - Key members of Venezuela s opposition, divided and dispirited after losing gubernatorial elections over the weekend, will travel abroad to denounce what it says is a  fraudulent  voting system under leftist President Nicolas Maduro.  Congress president Julio Borges said in a press conference on Thursday that the opposition coalition will try to stir up international support, which could result in further sanctions against Maduro s administration.  His unpopular government unexpectedly swept to victory in Sunday s regional vote, pocketing 18 of 23 states in the midst of a debilitating economic crisis that has millions skipping meals as soaring inflation destroys salaries.  Polls had forecast the opposition easily beating the ruling socialists. Maduro s rivals say a mix of dirty tricks, like  moving hundreds of voting centers in opposition areas at the last minute and including the names of opposition politicians who lost in primaries on ballots, worked against them.   We made a huge effort, we aimed to overcome all the obstacles, and what the government did was upgrade its fraud and its cheating,  said Borges, adding that politicians were due to travel to fellow Latin American countries and other supportive nations shortly.   We have the full records of this electoral process and we re going to submit them to various international bodies, so that ... they can be audited,  added Borges, who did not provide further details on the trips. While the opposition first cried fraud, without providing proof, it later scaled back its accusations and is now focusing on the minerals-rich state of Bolivar where it says its losing candidate was robbed of decisive votes.  Maduro blasted his opponents as sore losers who cry fraud when convenient. On Thursday, he inaugurated Hector Rodriguez, a rising star in the Socialist Party, as governor of Miranda state in a ceremony filled with song and dance.  Opposition politicians have acknowledged that demoralization in their own ranks hurt turnout. Many opposition supporters are exhausted after four months of protests earlier this year and were loath to participate in what some saw as a rigged vote that would legitimize Maduro as a dictator.  They were even more downbeat after the vote, however, as it casts doubt on whether they can remove the ruling Socialist Party in next year s presidential election.   The government s handling of (Sunday s) vote suggests that it is not even willing to entertain anything close to free and fair presidential elections in 2018, even if it prompts growing international isolation, renewed unrest, and increased outward migration,  consultancy Eurasia wrote in a note to clients this week.

"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Commission preparations to retaliate against proposed new U.S. sanctions on Russia that could affect European firms are likely to face resistance within a bloc divided on how to deal with Moscow, diplomats, officials and experts say. A bill agreed by U.S. Senate and House leaders foresees fines for companies aiding Russia to build energy export pipelines. EU firms involved in Nord Stream 2, a 9.5 billion euro ($11.1 billion) project to carry Russian gas across the Baltic, are likely to be affected. Both the European Union and the United States imposed broad economic sanctions on Russia���������s financial, defense and energy sectors in response to Moscow���������s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and its direct support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. But northern EU states in particular have sought to shield the supplies of Russian gas that they rely on.  Markus Beyrer, director of the EU���������s main business lobby, Business Europe, urged Washington to ���������avoid unilateral actions that would mainly hit the EU, its citizens and its companies���������. The Commission, the EU executive, will discuss next steps on Wednesday, a day after the U.S. House of Representatives votes on the legislation, knowing that the U.S. move threatens to reopen divisions over the bloc���������s own Russia sanctions. Among the European companies involved in Nord Stream 2 are German oil and gas group Wintershall, German energy trading firm Uniper, Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell, Austria���������s OMV and France���������s Engie. The Commission could demand a formal U.S. promise to exclude EU energy companies; use EU laws to block U.S. measures against European entities; or impose outright bans on doing business with certain U.S. companies, an EU official said. But if no such promise is offered, punitive sanctions such as limiting the access of U.S. companies to EU banks require unanimity from the 28 EU member states. Ex-Soviet states such as Poland and the Baltic states are unlikely to vote for retaliation to protect a project they have resisted because it would increase EU dependence on Russian gas. An EU official said most member states saw Nord Stream 2 as ���������contrary or at least not fully in line with European objectives��������� of reducing reliance on Russian energy. Britain, one of the United States��������� closest allies, is also wary of challenging the U.S. Congress as it prepares to leave the EU and seeks a trade deal with Washington. In fact, the EU���������s chief executive, Jean-Claude Juncker, has few tools that do not require unanimous support from the bloc���������s 28 governments. The Commission could act alone to file a complaint at the World Trade Organisation. But imposing punitive tariffs on U.S. goods would require detailed proof to be gathered that European companies were being unfairly disadvantaged - a process that would take many months. Diplomatic protests such as cutting EU official visits to Washington are unlikely to have much effect, since requests by EU commissioners for meetings with members of Trump���������s administration have gone unanswered, EU aides say. As if to highlight the confusion in the EU���������s position, two sources in Brussels told Reuters that Germany was urging the EU to add up to four more Russian nationals and companies to the bloc���������s own sanctions blacklist, after evidence emerged that gas turbines built by Germany���������s Siemens had been delivered to Crimea in contravention of sanctions. As the EU���������s trade with Russia has tumbled, keeping unity to maintain the sanctions has been strained by rival business interests that have been worsened by a perceived lack of U.S. leadership since President Donald Trump entered the White House in January. However, the White House said on Sunday that Trump was open to signing the bill once it is agreed. Meanwhile there is little or no sign that the Western sanctions have had any tangible effect in Ukraine, as the Russian-backed rebellion in the country���������s industrial east continues unabated.

"SEOUL (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will wrap up his visit to Seoul on Wednesday with a major speech on North Korea and then shift focus to China, where he is expected to press a reluctant President Xi Jinping to tighten the screws further on Pyongyang,  U.S. officials say. Trump s address to South Korea s National Assembly will come a day after he seemed to take a more balanced approach: threatening to use America s full military might against North Korea if needed, but also offering it a diplomatic opening to  make a deal  to end the nuclear standoff. While Trump presented no specific solution to his toughest global security challenge, his more conciliatory rhetoric toward North Korea could help lower tensions between Washington and Pyongyang that have put much of the east Asian region on edge over the prospects for military conflict. It contrasted markedly with Trump s earlier threats to  totally destroy  North Korea if it threatened the United States, and the personal insults he exchanged with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. It remains to be seen, however, whether the unpredictable Trump, in his final day on North Korea s doorstep, will build  on this approach or return to the bellicose language that has characterized his handling of the North Korean issue. Trump s official  talking points  for his Asia tour show that he intends to use the speech in part to contrast South Korea s  amazing rise  with North Korea s  sad, backward  state  and to urge resolve against Pyongyang, according to a confidential document reviewed by Reuters. He is also expected to condemn Pyongyang for its poor human rights record. Trump will then fly to Beijing where, according to senior administration officials, he will try to convince Xi to squeeze North Korea further with steps such as limits on oil exports, coal imports and financial transactions. Previewing his Beijing visit, Trump told a news conference in Seoul on Tuesday that China and North Korea s other giant neighbor, Russia, were among countries whose cooperation will be  crucial in getting North Korea to rein in its nuclear and missile programs.  President Xi   has been very helpful. We ll find out how helpful soon,  Trump said. But it is far from clear if Xi, who has just consolidated his power at a Communist Party congress, will agree to do more. China says its leverage over Pyongyang is exaggerated by the West, and points to its support in the U.N. Security Council for recent sanctions on North Korea as evidence that it is doing all it can to curtail the isolated nation s nuclear and missile tests.  On this issue, China s position and stance is already very clear and staunch,  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Monday.  Everyone can see clearly that we don t need anybody to tell us what we should be doing.  But with Trump appearing to crack open the  door to diplomacy with North Korea   something that China has long urged   he may have a better chance of securing further promises to intensify economic pressure on North Korea, which relies on Beijing for more than 90 percent of its trade. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, however, has seemed willing to risk snubbing China when he deems it useful as he pursues development of a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. At the same time, Xi may be mindful that Trump has held off on trade actions against China that he loudly threatened during the 2016 presidential campaign to give Beijing more time to make progress on North Korea. For his part, Xi will also be looking to maintain the good personal chemistry the two leaders developed when Trump hosted him at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in April. The  bromance  is set to continue when Xi returns the favor by laying on a lavish welcome for Trump s visit starting on Wednesday. Trump is expected to go to the Forbidden City, possibly guided by Xi, and participate in an inspection of Chinese troops, though China has released few other details.

"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil s Supreme Court on Wednesday decided to grant Congress the final word on decisions to remove a sitting politician, conceding a victory to lawmakers fighting to shield themselves from prosecution for corruption. The narrow 6-5 decision will allow the Senate to vote next week to revoke a top court ruling that suspended Senator Aecio Neves who is being investigated in seven corruption cases. A majority of the justices decided to back off from confrontation with Congress in the midst of Brazil s biggest political corruption scandal, which has even implicated President Michel Temer and his inner circle of cabinet ministers. The lower house of Congress is expected to vote later this month to shelve charges against Temer in a corruption case involving meatpacker JBS SA, saving him from trial by the Supreme Court. More than 110 politicians are targeted by the sprawling Car Wash graft investigation that has uncovered since 2014 a massive network of bribes and kickbacks paid by companies seeking to win government contracts and influence legislation. Congress has pushed back against judicial action by the Supreme Court since the justices ordered the removal of the former speaker of the lower house, Eduardo Cunha, who was  arrested last year, convicted of corruption and sentenced to more than 15 years in prison for corruption. One third of the politicians in Brazil s Congress - more than 230 - including more than half of its senators, are being investigated for breaking the law and face trial by the Supreme Court, the only court that can try lawmakers and ministers. Those being investigated include the presidents of the Senate and the lower house, and many of the leaders of Temer s governing coalition. In another gain for the political class, the Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that no one can be charged merely on the basis of plea bargain testimony by just one witness if no evidence is provided to back up the accusation. Plea deals have been the main tool used by anti-corruption prosecutors to track the network of political kickbacks and   dismantle graft schemes discovered at oil company Petrobras and other state-run enterprises. The ruling was part of a decision to throw out corruption and money laundering charges against Senator Renan Calheiros, the former president of the Senate who faces seven other graft investigations.

"LONDON (Reuters) - An aardvark was killed and four meerkats are missing believed dead after a blaze tore through part of London Zoo early on Saturday, destroying a cafe and gift shop. The fire broke out shortly after 0600 GMT at the zoo s Animal Adventure section before spreading to the shop and cafe, near to an area where visitors can handle and feed animals, the zoo and London Fire Brigade said. More than 70 firefighters took three hours to bring the fire under control while desperate keepers who live on the site in Regent s Park in central London moved animals to safety. Some of the staff needed treatment for smoke inhalation and shock. Ten-year-old Misha the aardvark, one of the zoo s best-loved animals, perished in the fire and four of the meerkats were unaccounted for and are also presumed to have died. Taking their name from the Afrikaans word for  earth-pig , aardvarks are large burrowing mammals found across much of Africa.  We re absolutely devastated that Misha the aardvark has been killed and we re still trying to find out what happened to the meerkats, but at the moment the site where this fire took place is closed down,  Dominic Jermey, the zoo s Director General, told BBC TV.   At the moment we re not certain what has happened to the meerkats but I m not optimistic at this stage, unfortunately.  Other animals nearby are being monitored by vets, but the zoo said indications were that they were unaffected. It said it hoped to reopen on Sunday. It is the world s oldest scientific zoo, dating from 1826, and houses 20,166 animals, according to its inventory for 2017.  The fire brigade said it had sent 10 fire engines and 72 firefighters to the scene and added that the cause of the blaze was under investigation.  The fire mainly involved the cafe and shop but part of a nearby animal petting area was also affected,  said Station Manager David George.   When they arrived our crews were faced with a very well developed fire. They worked incredibly hard in arduous conditions to bring it under control as quickly as possible and to stop it from spreading to neighboring animal enclosures.  ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jeffrey Gundlach, the widely followed investor who runs DoubleLine Capital, foresees a ���������global growth scare��������� between now and the end of the summer, triggered by a presidential nomination of Donald Trump. ���������That is where I see the vulnerabilities,��������� Gundlach said in a telephone interview on Monday. Trump���������s protectionist policies could mean negative global growth, Gundlach warned. ���������As he gets the nomination, the markets and investors are going to worry about it more. You will see a downgrading of global growth based on geopolitical risks. You must factor this into your risk-management.���������  Trump has blamed currency devaluations around the world for hurting the U.S. economy and costing American jobs, and has called for a tougher U.S. stance on trade. ���������We just sit back and do nothing,��������� Trump said earlier this month. ���������That���������s getting to be very dangerous as far as I���������m concerned.��������� A more effective economic move than devaluations would be charging a tax on products made abroad and sold in the United States, particularly those from China, Trump said. Gundlach, who oversees $93 billion at Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital, said it isn���������t premature to think about a Trump nomination. ���������You have to entertain the hypothetical.��������� Phone calls and emails to Trump���������s spokeswoman were not returned.   For its part, stock markets, which moved into positive territory after the U.S. Federal Reserve���������s dovish move last week, will continue to track oil prices, Gundlach said, who was prescient in his call for $40 per barrel. ���������I think oil will have a hard time moving up to $45,��������� Gundlach said. The risk-reward proposition is ���������so bad right now because you had this easy rally��������� in risk markets, Gundlach said. He added: ���������No way I would buy junk bonds at this level.���������  Gundlach also criticized Fed officials for changing their stance on interest rates. ���������They���������ve been flip-flopping like crazy over the past few months,��������� he said.      Just three days after the Fed held interest rates and cautioned ���������global economic and financial developments continue to pose risks,��������� Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said on Monday that the United States may be in line for an interest rate hike as soon as April given ���������sufficient momentum��������� in U.S. growth.  Gundlach said it���������s become obvious Fed officials are seeking guidance from markets. ���������If it is going to be about the markets, they should just come out and say, ���������If the S&P hits 2,100 we will tighten - and if it goes to 1,900 we will ease,��������� Gundlach said.

"OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) - Two paramilitary police officers were killed and two others wounded in Burkina Faso when a convoy carrying fuel to the Inata gold mine hit a landmine, Avocet Mining Plc and the government said on Wednesday. Nobody immediately claimed responsibility for the incident although security analysts have attributed other recent attacks in gold-rich northern Burkina Faso to a new local jihadist group known as Ansaroul Islam.  The explosion destroyed the leading vehicle, killing two gendarmes and seriously wounding two others,  the defense ministry said in a statement. The explosion was caused by an improvised explosive device on the road from the town of Djibo, about 150 kilometers (90 miles) north of the capital Ouagadougou, it added. The mining firm said it would review security measures and take measures to ensure the safety of the mine and its employees. Burkina Faso, like other countries in West Africa, has been targeted sporadically by jihadist groups, including one founded by a local radical preacher, Ibrahim Dicko, who was released from prison in Mali in 2015. Most attacks have been along its remote northern border with Mali, which has seen activity by Islamist militants for more than a decade. A security source said that short bursts of gunfire rang out briefly overnight near the Inata mine as an anti-terror unit of the paramilitary police pursued the suspected attackers. Suspected Islamist militants killed at least 18 people and wounded several during a raid on a restaurant in Burkina Faso s capital in August. Shares in Avocet closed down 4.9 percent after initially falling some 10 percent on the London stock exchange. Avocet had said earlier this month that its unit, Societe des Mines de Belahouro (SMB), which operates the Inata gold mine, may file for insolvency after a loan repayment freeze with its creditors expired. The company owns 90 percent of the Inata Gold Mine that produced 72,485 ounces of gold in 2016.

The EU and Britain, which is will leave the EU in March 2019, agreed last Friday on the divorce terms in three key areas   a financial settlement, citizens  rights and how to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. The European Commission said on Monday the deal was not legally binding yet, but it regarded it  as a deal between gentlemen  with  the clear understanding that it is fully backed and endorsed by the UK government . But Britain s Brexit minister David Davis said on Sunday that the deal, which allows both sides to start talks on a future trade agreement crucial for Britain, was more of a  statement of intent  than a legally binding measure. This caused concern among EU officials that London may want to go back on the agreement.   Remarks by David Davis that Phase One deal last week not binding were unhelpful and undermines trust. European Parliament text will now reflect this and insist agreement translated into legal text as soon as possible,  Guy Verhofstadt, who leads the European Parliament Brexit coordination team, tweeted. He said that after Davis s  unacceptable remarks , the European Parliament will ask EU leaders meeting on Brexit on Friday to formally make negotiations on a future trade agreement with London conditional on including the agreement so far in full in the treaty on Britain leaving the EU. A draft text which leaders are set to adopt on Friday already states that  negotiations in the second phase can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken during the first phase are respected in full and translated faithfully in legal terms as quickly as possible .

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name Wilbur Ross, a billionaire known for his investments in distressed industries, to head the Commerce Department, a Republican source familiar with the decision told Reuters on Tuesday. An announcement on Ross to lead the department, which pursues anti-dumping cases against cheap foreign imports, could come as early as Wednesday, NBC News said. Ross declined to comment to Reuters on Tuesday. Ross, 78, a staunch supporter of Trump and an economic adviser, has helped shape the Trump campaign���������s views on trade policy, blaming the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and the 2001 entry of China into the World Trade Organization for causing massive U.S. factory job losses.   ���������I think there���������s a big difference between the impact of trade agreements on corporate America and the impact on Mr. and Mrs. America,��������� Ross told CNBC in an interview earlier this year. ���������Corporate America has adjusted to them by investing lots of capital offshore.���������     Ross, whose net worth was pegged by Forbes at about $2.9 billion, heads the private equity firm, W.L. Ross & Co in New York. Ross��������� connections to Trump date back to 1990, when as a turnaround expert for Rothschild and Co he worked on behalf of bondholders to help engineer a restructuring of hundreds of millions of dollars in debt owed on Trump���������s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. In 2002, by then in charge of his own private equity firm, Ross formed International Steel Group to consolidate several bankrupt steelmakers, including Bethlehem Steel, Acme Steel and LTV Steel. He sold the company in a $4.5 billion deal two years later to Mittal Steel. Ross retains a stake in what is now part of the world���������s largest steel company, Arcelor Mittal, and sits on its board of directors. His various business interests, which also include automotive components and textiles, could make avoiding conflicts of interest a complicated prospect as the head of an agency with broad influence over trade cases and U.S. industrial policies.  Arcelor Mittal has benefited from several recent anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties imposed by the Commerce Department against a wide range of steel products from China, South Korea, Japan, Britain, Turkey and other countries. Those have helped lift domestic steel prices, boosting the company���������s bottom line. Ross may also face questions from lawmakers over the January 2006 Sago coal mine disaster in West Virginia that killed 12 miners in an explosion and collapse. Owned by a subsidiary of one of his companies, International Coal Group, the mine had been cited for more than 200 safety violations  International Coal was sold for $3.4 billion in 2011 to No. 2 U.S. coal miner Arch Coal, which filed for bankruptcy protection in January amid plummeting coal prices.  He could be questioned as well over a $2.3 million fine his firm agreed to pay in August to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle accusations it did not properly disclose some fees that it charged investors.

"(Reuters) - Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday called for surveillance of mosques as part of U.S. law enforcement efforts to prevent terrorism, and stood by his remarks on banning Muslim immigrants, which others in his party have criticized. Trump repeated his call for a temporary ban on the entry of Muslims into the United States after a U.S.-born Muslim, the son of Afghan immigrants, fatally shot 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando early on Sunday. The New York real estate developer said that while the Florida gunman was born in the United States, ���������his parents weren���������t and his ideas weren���������t born here.���������  ���������We have to maybe check, respectfully, the mosques and we have to check other places because this is a problem that, if we don���������t solve it, it���������s going to eat our country alive,��������� Trump said at a rally in Atlanta. Trump had called for surveillance of mosques in November, as well as a database of Syrian refugees entering the United States. The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, is believed by authorities to have acted alone, inspired by radical ideology he was exposed to over the internet. ���������Any kind of extremism and violence is not preached in American mosques,��������� said Ibrahim Hooper, communications director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. ���������In fact, research has shown that mosques are a moderating influence on individuals who attend.��������� Prominent Republicans this week distanced themselves from Trump���������s comments about Muslims.  House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday he did not think a ban on the entry of Muslims was in U.S. interests. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who ran against Trump for the Republican nomination and has been a fierce critic since, said that he was ���������unnerved��������� by Trump���������s response. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said on Wednesday that Trump���������s rhetoric had grown ���������even more inflammatory��������� in recent days. She said the United States counts on Muslim communities in the U.S. and partners in majority-Muslim countries to help fight terrorism. ���������Not one of Donald Trump���������s reckless ideas would have saved a single life in Orlando,��������� Clinton said at an event for U.S. military families in Virginia. Trump on Monday proposed that the United States suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is ���������a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats.��������� He also said radical Muslims were entering the country amid a flood of refugees and ���������trying to take over our children.��������� Trump���������s hard-line proposals on immigration have contributed to his popularity among some conservative voters. But they have also triggered condemnation from minority and human rights activists and his political opponents, many of whom have called his rhetoric racist. The New York businessman also said in Atlanta he would meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un if he came to the United States, and he dismissed the controversy he caused in May when he said in a Reuters interview he would be willing to speak to Kim. ���������If he came here, I���������d accept him. But I wouldn���������t give a state dinner like we do for China and all these other people  that rip us off,��������� Trump said. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Economic sanctions are a powerful policy weapon but should not be wielded ���������frivolously,��������� U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said in an interview to be aired on Tuesday. Sanctions - blacklisting individuals and organizations, effectively barring them from the global financial system - have become a favored tool for the United States. It has used them against challenges as varied as drug trafficking, cyber attacks and jihadist financing. But the impact has to be weighed as carefully as those of military force, Lew said in an interview with Public Television host Charlie Rose, according to a transcript of the interview released on Tuesday. ���������We can���������t shy away from using sanctions because it will slow down growth, but we can���������t do it frivolously either,��������� Lew said. ���������It���������s a serious step, and it���������s something that has to be guarded in order to have it in the future when you need it.��������� U.S. sanctions have evolved over time from broad embargoes - such as the one imposed for decades on Cuba - to more targeted actions, he said, citing measures imposed on specific Russian industries in response to Russia���������s intervention in Ukraine. ���������They���������re targeted at the centers of power, where the decisions are being made,��������� Lew said. The United States also should reward countries that change their behavior by removing sanctions, Lew said, pointing to measures against Iran that he credited with leading Tehran to agree to curb its nuclear program. Iran reached a deal with the United States and other world powers last July, winning relief from the harshest sanctions in return for limiting its nuclear program, which the West feared was aimed at building a weapon. ���������When you have an agreement that���������s predicated on ���������Change your policy and get relief from the sanctions,��������� there has to be relief from the sanctions,��������� Lew said. ���������Otherwise, no one will ever respond to a sanctions regime by changing their policy.��������� Reversing the Iran nuclear deal under a new administration - as Republican presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz has pledged to do - would be ���������destabilizing and dangerous,��������� Lew said. A broad economic embargo remains in place against Cuba, although President Barack Obama has used executive authority to allow commerce not specifically banned by Congress, as Washington and Havana move closer toward normal relations. Those improved ties are ���������going to be a force for change��������� in Cuba, Lew said. ���������We weren���������t getting it done the old way.��������� ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"PHOENIX (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice has launched an investigation into the handling of last month���������s presidential nominating contest in Arizona���������s most populous county, citing complaints of exceedingly long lines at polling places with high levels of minority voters. The Justice Department���������s civil rights division has asked Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, to provide detailed information that could help authorities determine whether the March 22 primary election violated federal law, including how the number and locations of polls were decided. The Justice Department made the request in a letter dated April 1. The letter followed a call for a federal probe by Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, immediately after the election, calling the vote ���������a fiasco��������� as he cited ���������unacceptably disparate distribution of polling locations.��������� In what officials called a cost-cutting move, Maricopa County slashed its polling sites to 60, down from 200 in 2012. Voters last month waited in line for up to five hours to cast ballots and well into the night at the sharply reduced number of polls.  In its letter, the Justice Department cites reports of ���������a disproportional burden in waiting times ... in some areas with substantial racial or language minority populations.��������� The Justice Department set an April 22 deadline for a response. Following the election, officials said their decisions on polling places were based on recent voting patterns and an increasing number of mail-in ballots. Karen Osborne, county elections director, denied there was any intent to rob voters of their rights and said officials would comply with the Justice Department request. ���������This is a request for information,��������� Osborne said in a brief interview on Monday with Reuters. ���������We are going to gather the information, and we will get it together by the 22nd, and we will make it public.��������� The state formally certified the election on Monday and candidates have five days to contest the results. In the Republican contest, Donald Trump won, while in the Democratic contest, Hillary Clinton won. An attorney for Democrat Bernie Sanders has said his campaign is considering a challenge.

"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau broke some conflict of interest rules when he accepted a vacation last year on the Aga Khan s private island, the ethics watchdog said on Wednesday, the first time a prime minister has been found to have committed such a transgression. While the finding could tarnish Trudeau s popularity half-way into his mandate, he does not face any penalties. Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner Mary Dawson said Trudeau contravened a rule on gifts when he accepted the use of the island in March and December 2016, while there were ongoing official dealings with the Aga Khan and the Aga Khan Foundation Canada was registered to lobby Trudeau s office.  The vacations accepted by Mr. Trudeau or his family could reasonably be seen to have been given to influence Mr. Trudeau in his capacity as Prime Minister,  Dawson said. While Trudeau says the Aga Khan is a family friend, Dawson found the exception for gifts from friends did not apply. Trudeau said he accepted her report and would clear future vacations with the watchdog.  I take full responsibility for it. We need to make sure that the office of the prime minister is without reproach,  Trudeau said.  Trudeau and his family vacationed on the island during the holidays in late December 2016 into January this year. Members of his family visited in March 2016. Trudeau has come under fire from the opposition, who have said the luxury Bahamas vacation was inappropriate and showed the Liberal government is out of touch with average Canadians. The opposition has also accused Finance Minister Bill Morneau of being in a conflict of interest for not putting his assets in a blind trust. He has since said he will do so and has divested his stock in his family business.  Trudeau says he has known the Aga Khan, Prince Shah Karim Al Husseini, since childhood. The Aga Khan, the title held by the leader of the Ismaili branch of Shi ite Islam, was a pallbearer at the funeral of Justin s father, former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Trudeau also contravened the rules when he and his family traveled in the Aga Khan s private helicopter last December and when his family traveled on a non-commercial aircraft chartered by the Aga Khan in March 2016, Dawson said. However, she found no evidence Trudeau discussed any parliamentary business with the Aga Khan or his representatives, or participated in any related debates or votes.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday approved the budget for the auditing watchdog that oversees the work of leading U.S. accounting firms. The SEC staff recommended approving the budget of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and SEC Commission Chair Mary Jo White and Commissioner Kara Stein endorsed the $257.7 million budget. Commissioner Michael S. Piwowar voted against, saying he was skeptical of the nearly 3 percent increase in the PCAOB budget from a year ago. He also said he was not persuaded that the additional burden on accounting firms and broker-dealers, which fund the PCAOB through fees, was merited. ���������The Commission represents the only safeguard to an otherwise unilateral ability to impose the accounting support fee on companies and broker-dealers,��������� said. The SEC controls the budget and assigns members of the PCAOB, which was conceived to prevent future accounting scandals like the one that brought down energy company Enron in 2001. The SEC has two vacant seats and the Senate Banking Committee is due on Tuesday to consider two nominees put forward by the White House. Commission Chair Mary Jo White has said she intends to wait until the agency once again has its full, five-member panel before moving forward to appoint a new PCAOB chief.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump would be inclined to replace Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen if he wins the White House despite supporting the U.S. central bank���������s efforts to keep interest rates low, he told Fortune magazine. ���������I think she���������s done a serviceable job,��������� Trump said in an interview published late on Tuesday, as the billionaire real estate mogul moved a step closer to becoming his party���������s nominee with a resounding win in New York state���������s Republican nominating contest.  ���������I don���������t want to comment on reappointment, but I would be more inclined to put other people in.��������� Yellen was nominated for the top Fed job by Democratic President Barack Obama, and began her four-year term in February 2014. Nominees need Senate approval, after which they are protected from political interference until their terms expire. In his interview, Trump said he ���������absolutely��������� backed efforts to diminish the Fed���������s power and allow Congress to launch so-called ���������audits,��������� or outside reviews, of its policy decisions. He also backed away from his pledge to erase the more than $19 trillion in U.S. debt in eight years. Representatives for the Fed declined to comment on the report.  Were Yellen to step down in 2018 after only one term, it would be the shortest Fed chairmanship since 1979. Since then, Fed chairs from Paul Volcker to Alan Greenspan to Ben Bernanke, Yellen���������s predecessor, were reappointed by at least one incoming U.S. president.  Trump said he favored the low interest rate environment and that raising rates would be a blow to the U.S. economy. Trump had accused the Fed in November of keeping rates low to help Obama, an assertion the White House rejected. ���������The best thing we have going for us is that interest rates are so low,��������� the New York billionaire businessman told Fortune.  ���������If rates are 3 percent or 4 percent or whatever, you start adding that kind of number to an already reasonably crippled economy in terms of what we produce, that number is a very scary number,��������� Trump added. The Fed cut its key overnight lending rate to near zero in late 2008 and kept it there for the next seven years to help the economy recover from the financial crisis. It raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point last December, its first hike in nearly a decade. Trump told Fortune he would take advantage of lower rates to refinance the country���������s debt and boost government spending on infrastructure and the military. The magazine will publish a full transcript of the interview later this week.  He moved away from comments he made to the Washington Post earlier this month pledging to eliminate the national debt ���������over a period of eight years.��������� Instead, Trump told Fortune he could tackle a portion of it. ���������You could pay off a percentage of it, depending on how aggressive you want to be,��������� he said. ���������I���������d rather not be all that aggressive. I���������d rather not have debt, but we���������re stuck with it.���������  Trump���������s main Republican rival, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, has said he would audit the Fed and move it to a rules-based monetary policy. Other U.S. presidential candidates, including Democrat Bernie Sanders, have also pledged to change the Fed. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"(Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie ordered a halt to non-essential road, bridge and mass transit projects late Thursday after lawmakers failed to reauthorize the state fund that pays for them. Christie���������s executive order calls for the state Department of Transportation and New Jersey Transit to devise a plan before midnight Saturday for the ���������orderly��������� shutdown of projects funded by the Transportation Trust Fund. Federally funded projects will continue, Christie said in his executive order.  The state expects to receive an estimated $906 million of federal transportation aid, according to the state treasurer���������s annual report. New Jersey���������s ability to borrow for new transportation projects ran out on Friday, the start of the new fiscal year. The trust fund already has about $16 billion of outstanding debt for existing road projects. The fund has roughly $80 million left, said Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman John Wisniewski, who called Christie���������s executive order ���������pure theater.���������         Without new appropriations or bond proceeds, the authority cannot pay vendors for construction. Projects at any stage - procurement, design and construction - are affected by Christie���������s order, the Department of Transportation said. About a month ago, lawmakers discussed issuing grant anticipation revenue bonds, or so-called GARVEEs, as a stop-gap measure, but the idea was never acted upon, Wisniewski told Reuters. The flow of federal money backing those bonds is often uncertain from year to year. ���������You can���������t do an annual capital program on GARVEE bonds,��������� he said. Christie ordered the remaining money in the fund to be held only for the most essential projects ���������in order to protect the health, safety and welfare��������� of New Jerseyans, he said. Christie had hatched a late-night deal earlier this week with the Assembly to raise the state gasoline tax by 23 cents to 37.5 cents per gallon to replenish the fund. In exchange, the sales tax rate would shrink 1 percentage point to 6 percent, which could lead to an annual $1.7 billion shortfall in future budgets. But the Senate ended its session on Thursday without replenishing the program, which is expected to run out of money in August.  Senators were pushing their own bill, which would have phased out the estate tax on wealthy residents instead of reducing sales taxes. Christie also stripped several items out of the legislature���������s budget on Thursday, signing a reduced $34.5 billion budget for fiscal 2017 that is just 2.1 percent higher than that for fiscal 2016.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States will consider resuming some suspended military assistance to Eypt, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday. The U.S. government last month decided to deny Egypt $95.7 million in aid and to delay a further $195 million over human rights concerns. Asked if he would restart military to aid to Egypt, Trump told reporters as he began a meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi:  We re going to certainly consider it.  On Aug. 27, sources said the Trump administration decided to  reprogram  $65.7 million in fiscal year 2017 Foreign Military Financing funds and $30 million in fiscal year 2016 Economic Support Fund funds.  Reprogramming  means these funds would be used for other purposes and would not go to Egypt. The administration made a separate decision to withhold $195 million in fiscal year 2016 Foreign Military Financing funds which, had it not acted, would have expired and ceased to be available at the end of the current fiscal year on Sept. 30. These sums are relatively small in comparison to U.S. aid flows to Egypt historically. According to a March 2017 report by the bipartisan Congressional Research Service, between 1948 and 2016 the United States gave Egypt $77.4 billion in bilateral foreign aid, including $1.3 billion a year in military aid from 1987 to the present.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said she spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday about Rohingya Muslims flooding into her country from Myanmar, but she expects no help from him as he has made clear how he feels about refugees. As Trump left an event he hosted at the United Nations on reforming the world body, Hasina said she stopped him for a few minutes.  He just asked how is Bangladesh? I said  it s doing very well, but the only problem that we have is the refugees from Myanmar ,  Hasina told Reuters in an interview.  But he didn t make any comment about refugees.  A Myanmar military response to insurgent attacks last month in the country s Rakhine state sent more than 410,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh, escaping what the United Nations has branded as ethnic cleansing. The Myanmar government says about 400 people have been killed in the fighting.  Hasina, who is due to address the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday, said Trump s stance on refugees was clear, so it was not worth asking him for help with the Rohingya Muslim refugees.   Already America declared that they will not allow any refugees,  she said.  What I can expect from them, and especially (the) president. He already declared his mind ... so why I should ask?   Bangladesh is not a rich country ... but if we can feed 160 million people, another 500 or 700,000 people, we can do it.  A senior White House official was unaware of the exchange but said Trump was deeply interested in the subject and that  he would definitely engage if it were brought up.  Shortly after taking office in January, Trump tried to put a 120-day halt on the U.S. refugee program, bar Syrian refugees indefinitely and impose a 90-day suspension on people from six predominantly Muslim countries.    The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!  Trump said on Twitter on Friday.  Trump says the move is needed to prevent terrorist attacks and allow the government to put in place more stringent vetting procedures. There is a key Supreme Court hearing next month on the constitutionality of his executive order on the ban. About a million Rohingya lived in Rakhine State until the recent violence. Most face travel restrictions and are denied citizenship in a country where many Buddhists regard them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.  Hasina said she wanted to see more international political pressure on Myanmar to allow the Rohingya to return.   (Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi) should agree that these people belong to her country and that Myanmar is their country. They should take them back,  she said.  These people are suffering.  Nobel laureate Suu Kyi has faced a barrage of international criticism for not stopping the violence. Myanmar national security adviser Thaung Tun told Reuters on Monday that Myanmar would ensure those who left their homes could return, but there was  a process we have to discuss.  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley urged the Myanmar government to end military operations, grant humanitarian access, and commit to aiding the safe return of civilians to their homes.  People are still at risk of being attacked or killed, humanitarian aid is not reaching the people who need it, and innocent civilians are still fleeing across the border to Bangladesh,  Haley said after Britain hosted a meeting on the crisis in New York on Monday. A U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state, Patrick Murphy, is due in Myanmar this week. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bitterly divided U.S. Senate confirmed Republican Senator Jeff Sessions on Wednesday as the next attorney general of the United States after strong pushback from Democrats concerned about his record on civil rights.  Sessions, 70, who has served two decades in the Senate from Alabama, was confirmed by a 52-47 vote largely along party lines after Democrats raised public opposition to his confirmation.  In a rare move for a senator recently confirmed to a Cabinet position, Sessions took to the floor of the chamber after the vote and called for members of Congress to have some ���������latitude��������� in their relationships with members of the other party.     ���������I want to thank those who after it all found sufficient confidence to confirm me as the next attorney general,��������� Sessions said.  ���������Denigrating people who disagree with us, I think, is not a healthy trend for our body,��������� he said, referring to the Senate. On Tuesday, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a darling of the political left, was silenced in the Senate for reading a 1986 letter from Coretta Scott King, the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., that criticized Sessions for his civil rights record. Democrats, civil rights and immigration groups have voiced alarm about Sessions��������� record of controversial positions on race, immigration and criminal justice reform.  With Sessions as attorney general, eight of President Donald Trump���������s 22 Cabinet nominees have been confirmed. The Republican-led Senate also voted on Wednesday to advance Representative Tom Price���������s nomination to head the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Senate is likely to vote to confirm Price on Friday. Sessions, a known immigration hardliner, will take the lead of the Justice Department as its lawyers are defending Trump���������s temporary entry ban on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries and all refugees, the most controversial executive order of the young administration.  The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is due to rule this week on whether to overrule a district court judge in Seattle who suspended the ban last week.  Civil rights groups worry that the Justice Department���������s civil rights division will not be aggressive in prosecuting abuses under Sessions. They cite his failure to win Senate confirmation to become a federal judge in 1986 because of allegations he made racist remarks, including testimony that he had called an African-American prosecutor ���������boy,��������� an allegation Sessions denied. Sessions said at his hearing in 1986 that groups such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union could be considered ���������un-American.��������� He also acknowledged he had called the Voting Rights Act of 1965 a ���������piece of intrusive legislation.���������  The left-leaning Center for American Progress think tank  questioned whether Sessions would be an independent legal voice to challenge Trump���������s agenda.  ���������Trump has shown little respect for the courts or the constitutional limits on his power, and there is no reason to think that Attorney General Sessions will act as an independent check on the president,��������� said Michele Jawando, vice president for legal progress at the think tank. Sessions has pushed to curb immigration into the United States, including by those who enter legally on work permits.  He has also voted against many measures to reduce sentences for prisoners. The Republican National Committee pushed back against what it called ���������obstructing��������� by Democrats.    ���������That Democrats would try to skew Sessions��������� strong civil rights record and consistent adherence to rule of law in a partisan effort to block their colleague���������s nomination shows their only commitment is to blindly obstructing this administration,��������� Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said on Sessions��������� confirmation.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday he wants Congress to pass legislation to protect illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children but offered no timetable, with existing safeguards due to expire in March. President Donald Trump last month rescinded a program created under his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama that protected the young adult illegal immigrants known as ���������Dreamers��������� from deportation and provided work permits. Asked in a Reuters interview whether he thought Congress could tackle legislation this year to help the ���������Dreamers,��������� Ryan said the timing was unclear. ���������I don���������t know when we���������re going to do it. We���������re having lots of discussions on how to do it, and the timing is something that���������s just open to debate.��������� ���������I want to do it,��������� Ryan said. ���������The goal is: we want to fix this and we���������re working on it, and we want to make sure that we do it in such a way that we don���������t have the same problem down the road - that means border security and interior enforcement.��������� The illegal immigrants protected under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program are primarily Hispanic young adults. Winning passage of legislation to protect the Dreamers may not be easy, as Congress has struggled for years to approve immigration-related legislation. Trump has taken a hard-line stance against illegal immigrants. Under Trump���������s action, the protections for the Dreamers disappear in the first week of March. He urged lawmakers to come up with an alternative before the protections expire. Trump took Republican congressional leaders by surprise last month when he met with top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer and top House of Representatives Democrat Nancy Pelosi about a potential deal on DACA. Schumer and Pelosi came away from the meeting saying they had the outlines of an agreement with Trump, but his administration subsequently made demands that angered Democrats including for funding of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats have said they see a budget vote in early December as a chance to try to force Republicans to accept legislation to help the Dreamers. In December, Congress will need to pass legislation to continue funding the federal government through the rest of the fiscal year that ends next Sept. 30. Republicans, who control both houses of Congress, will need Democratic votes to approve the spending bill. Senate rules require a super-majority of 60 votes in the 100-seat chamber to pass spending bills, and Republicans have a 52-48 majority. In the House, Republican hard-liners often oppose spending legislation. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

Incidents verified by the U.N. human rights office included seven air strikes on a prison in the Shaub district of Sanaa on Dec. 13 that killed at least 45 detainees thought to be loyal to President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who is backed by Saudi Arabia.  One can assume that was a mistake, they weren t intending to kill prisoners from their own side,  Colville said.  It s an illustration of lack of due precaution.  Other air strikes killed 14 children and six adults in a farmhouse in Hodeidah governorate on Dec. 15, as well as a woman and nine children returning from a wedding party in Marib governorate on Dec. 16, he said. Air strikes verified by the U.N. rights office in Sanaa, Saada, Hodeidah and Taiz governorates also injured 87 civilians.  If in a specific event due precaution is not taken or civilians are deliberately targeted, that can easily be a war crime,  Colville said.  It is up to a court to make a ruling, he said, but there had been so many similar incidents in Yemen, it would be hard to conclude war crimes had not taken place. On Tuesday Saudi air defenses intercepted a ballistic missile fired towards the capital Riyadh but there were no reports of casualties, the coalition said, the latest in a series of attacks by the Iran-aligned Houthi group in Yemen. The restrictions on access to Yemen imposed by the coalition became a total blockade on Nov. 6 though conditions were eased on Nov. 25 to allow aid ships and some commercial cargoes to reach the shattered Arabian Peninsula country. The U.N. World Food Programme has brought in enough food for 1.8 million people for two months, but far more is needed. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"BELFAST (Reuters) - The British government on Monday extended by 24 hours a deadline for Northern Ireland s political parties to re-establish a devolved regional executive and avoid London setting the region s annual budget for the first time in a decade.  The pro-British Democratic Unionist Party and the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party made progress in talks on Monday and they will continue talking on Tuesday, the British government s minister for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire said.   In the light of this, I believe it is right to defer the assessment on whether to introduce legislation to Parliament this week to enable an executive to be formed,  Brokenshire said in a statement.  The parties will recommence talks in the morning and I will reassess the position tomorrow night,  he said, adding that the British government would consider  certain additional requests  made by the parties.        Brokenshire had earlier indicated that if there was no deal by the end of Monday it would move to pass an annual budget for the region to ensure essential services are funded.  A budget set by the British government would be a major step towards direct rule from London for the first time in a decade, which observers have warned could destabilize a delicate political balance in the region.  The DUP and Sinn Fein have shared power for the past decade in a system created following a 1998 peace deal which ended three decades of violence in the province. But Sinn Fein in January pulled out complaining it was not being treated as an equal partner.  Talks between Sinn Fein and the DUP have stalled in recent weeks, in large part over proposals to improve the rights of Irish language speakers. Ahead of the talks, Sinn Fein regional assembly member Conor Murphy said the government could only be reformed  on the basis of equality, rights and respect , which would require concessions from the DUP.   While the DUP also said it wanted to see the executive re-established, ahead of the talks it called for London to bring forward the budget  to bring a measure of good government to Northern Ireland . Neither party spoke to assembled media on the state of the talks on Monday evening.  The outcome of talks was not expected to have an impact on the DUP s agreement to support British Prime Minister Theresa May s government in the British parliament. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California politics got a bit more racy on Wednesday, as producers and actors in the adult film business said they had formed a political action committee, or PAC, to fight a ballot initiative to require the use of condoms when shooting explicit sex scenes. The move by an industry association representing California���������s busy pornographers - a $4 billion industry in California whose loss could cost the state tens of millions in tax revenues and up to 20,000 jobs - is the latest chapter in a years-long skirmish with public health advocates over how best to prevent sexually transmitted disease among performers of pornography. Los Angeles, and especially the San Fernando Valley area, has historically been a hub of porn production. A number of high-profile X-rated performers in the area have suffered HIV infections, shaking the industry and local health officials. Nearly a dozen performers were infected with the HIV virus between 2004 and 2014, according to the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which is backing the ballot initiative. The group���������s measure, which will appear on the November ballot, would require the use of condoms and lubricants on adult film sets. It requires producers to provide the condoms and to offer free vaccinations and tests for sexually transmitted diseases to all performers. The measure also would allow performers or other individuals residing in California to ask for a state investigation into whether a particular adult film or video was made using condoms. If the state declines to investigate, that person can sue. Porn producers have focused on that section, saying it would lead to the harassment of actors. ���������It opens up the door to extortion and harassment of a predominantly female performer base and small business owners by those outside the industry,���������������said Mike Stabile, a spokesman for the Free Speech Coalition, the porn industry association. The new PAC, dubbed Californians Against Worker Harassment, is just beginning to raise funds, Stabile said. State records show that no contributions have yet been reported for its cause. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which is backing the initiative, has already contributed $1.5 million to promote it to the public, state records show. Los Angeles County passed a local ballot initiative also backed by AIDS Healthcare Foundation requiring condom use on porn shoots in 2012. But even though it has proven difficult to enforce, Stabile said the measure has led producers of sexually-explicit movies to film elsewhere. ",real,0,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

"Trump made a visit to the Keystone State in an effort to bolster his numbers for the upcoming Pennsylvania Republican primary election. While there, he managed to prove just how utterly CLUELESS he is about literally anything that happens in the state in two very huge ways, which you will see below.First came Trump s incredibly outdated remark about bringing back the steel industry s lost jobs to the state. Pennsylvania had a long history of major steel manufacturing, but the majority of it was lost decades ago. The jobs literally have been gone in many areas of the state for more than 20 years, and Trump thinks that him arguing with China will bring them back.As a Pennsylvanian myself, I can tell you it s really something that blue-collar and middle-class people do not forgive easily. Making what amounts to an ignorant mockery of an issue that many in the state still feel betrayed over due to massive outsourcing of industry from America, will hit Trump badly   especially among his somewhat aged voter demographics that lived through those days of economic collapse.If you thought that was bad, you haven t seen anything yet. Trump then went on to say something even more offensive about Penn State Football.Trump asked people at the gathering,  How s Joe Paterno? Are we gonna bring that back? How about that whole deal? The silence afterwards could have been cut with a hatchet.Here is just a short list of what s wrong with Trump s statement. Joe Paterno died in 2012. We won t be bringing him back. That  whole deal  Trump is talking about is a child sex scandal that was covered up within the Penn State football program, where a member of the staff was literally having sex with children on campus property. Joe Paterno was forced out over it.Literally EVERYONE in PA knows this. Penn State football is like a religion to many in the state, and for Trump to say what he did shows how ignorant he is about Pennsylvania. Insulting Penn State football is something literally nobody ever did in order to win an election in the state. I can t wait to see how this turns out for him on primary day. What a joke.Watch Trump suggest he wants to bring back a child sex scandal below:Featured image via video screen capture",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

"Italian Catholics are essentially being told to pray silently (hide their religious convictions) to avoid offending anyone, while Muslims are living free of charge in their church? I can t be the only Catholic who has a problem with this Parishioners in the Italian parish of St. Anthony in Ventimiglia, a small town in northwestern Italy about four miles from the border of France, were ordered Saturday by a Catholic aid organization volunteer to pray the Rosary silently so the Muslim migrants living in the church would not be offended.With a population of about 55,000, Ventimiglia has been overwhelmed by Muslim migrants, receiving over 50 every day, many of which are housed in Catholic churches.ANSA reports a parishioner snapped back at the volunteer, telling him to  bring migrants into another church.  The parish priest, Don Rito, instead took the parishioners to another church close by where they could pray out loud.Migrants have been pouring into the little town on their way to France and locals feel overwhelmed. The mayor of Ventimiglia, Enrico Ioculano, said the situation is  untenable.  But the Italian government and Caritas seem to do little to help the burden; already in the first five months of 2016 it has cost the town  220,000, less than half of which will be funded by the government.Caritas is also doing little to allay the town s burden. While it helps migrants who want to file for refugee status, saying they have  a special channel,  in March the local director said the organization can only afford to provide  for a few days  those who are passing through, whether they stay for a day or weeks.The Lepanto Institute describes Caritas Internationalis as a confederation of 165 Catholic relief, development and social service organizations operating in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.It has been exposed by the American Life League as being part of the Marxist organization the World Social Forum, promoting communism, abortion, and homosexuality throughout the world.WATCH HERE:Via: Church Militant",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"FOX News reporter John Roberts told President Trump that in an earlier interview, Hillary Clinton said she did not believe that the players taking a knee in the NFL was about disrespecting the flag. Roberts mentioned that Trump fired back in a tweet that he hoped Hillary would run again in 2020. Trump interrupted to say:  Oh I hope Hillary runs! Is she going to run? Please, Hillary, run again!   Trump responded that her way of agreeing with the players disrespecting our flag is the reason she lost the election, saying,  Well, that s why she l the election. I mean honestly, it s that thinking is why she lost the election. Trump said that he believes that Hillary s statement  in itself, is very disrespectful to our country.

"Two Muslim men were shot to death in broad daylight while walking in the New York City borough of Queens on Saturday. Both men were dressed in traditional Muslim clothing. One of the men, Ala Uddin Akongi, was a local Imam. He was killed instantly. Akongi s aide was shot and severely wounded. He was taken to the hospital where he died from his injuries. The gunman is still at large. Police are not currently treating the double-homicide as a hate crime, as the gunman s motive for the crime is not yet known.The New York Daily News reports that: Imam Alala Uddin Akongi, the married father of three, was a revered religious leader since his arrival in Queens from Bangladesh less than two years ago. His assistant, 65-year-old Thara Uddin, died about four hours after the attack.The shooter left his victims lying in their own blood just one block from the Al-Furqan Jame Masjid Mosque in Ozone Park, where the two prayed together only minutes earlier.The imam s nephew said Akongi had no problems with anyone in the neighborhood. Khairul Islam. A local resident, was quoted as saying that: That s not what America is about. We blame Donald Trump for this   Trump and his drama has created Islamophobia. Another local, Rahi Majid, said that: I m not sure what kind of an animal would kill that man. He would not hurt a fly. You would watch him come down the street and watch the peace he brings.

"Say it ain t so! The New York town of Bethlehem is being cleansed of all things Christmas and Hanukkah. Any and all signs of Christmas including a town sign that says Merry Christmas are gone. We can only say Bah Humbug! That little town in upstate New York shut down any hopes of happy holidays by voting to not display any  Merry Christmas  signs in public   and even taking down a banner for Hanukkah, too.The holiday hoopla followed apparent anxieties that this town near Albany   which shares a name with the birthplace of Jesus Christ himself   might appear to be favoring one religion over another.The town for years displayed a Christmas tree and a Menorah in its central Four Corners area, according to the Albany Times-Union. But it drew the line on signs that had any written messages   such as,  Merry Christmas  or  Happy Hanukkah. One resident, Elena Marcelle, bought a  Merry Christmas  sign for the town several years ago. This year, she said learned the town wasn t interested in hanging it up as usual. She asked town board members why. At first they said it was a traffic distraction,  Marcelle, 47, told the Daily News. The second reason is that they were afraid of infringing on constitutional rights. But the board had in fact voted to ditch worded displays altogether, meaning a  Happy Hanukkah  sign disappeared too.This despite a letter sent from the Alliance Defending Freedom, an Arizona-based conservative Christian group, urging Bethlehem to keep its holiday spirit alive. The irony is not lost on us that your town s name is Bethlehem,  the letter said, according to the Times-Union.Marcelle said she s amazed the town would mince words over holiday cheer. It was just a holiday greeting,  she said about her Christmas sign. I didn t ask to have a nativity scene. It would just recognize that Christmas is a holiday. The town has no law on the books banning any kind of holiday display. But town supervisor John Clarkson told The News the town s attorney warned the board this year that municipalities might get a legal lump of coal over any sign celebrating one holiday in particular. We re a municipality, not a religious entity,  Clarkson said. Advocating on behalf of any religion is one of those gray zones you don t want to get into. He said he saw no irony in Bethlehem stepping away from holiday greetings, noting that the town is at least sticking by its Christmas tree and Menorah presentations. I would say this little town of Bethlehem still has a really nice, homey holiday display,  he said.Via: NYDN",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

Instead of admitting that she might lose half of her voting base if they were to see her in a dress, she carries on forever about the ease of a pants suit.

"Alexander McCoy, a veteran of the U.S. Marines, helped led a protest outside Donald Trump s Trump Tower on Monday. The event was organized to shame Trump after recent reports revealed that he lied when he said he had raised $6 million to support veterans earlier in the year.In the video, McCoy explained that the episode shows that Trump  has not shown any honor in his actions or his policies.  He added,  he would make a reckless and dangerous commander-in-chief, and as Americans we would be fundamentally less safe with Donald Trump as president.  McCoy also referred to Trump as a  fraud. The veterans assembled outside the New York City landmark to raise awareness of what Trump has done.Former Marine Alexander McCoy and Army veteran Perry O Brien, who led the demonstration, have repeatedly said that Trump overstated the amount of money he raised at a Jan. 28 fundraiser for veterans causes to inflate his reputation among Republicans.

Trump put on the so-called fundraiser on the night he chose to skip out on the Republican primary debate because he was afraid of tough questioning from Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly.

Factcheck: U.S. District Court Judge Shira A. Scheindlin ruled  stop and frisk  to be unconstitutional August 12, 2013. According to the Center for Constitutional Rights, Judge Shira Scheindlin found the NYPD s practices to violate New Yorkers  Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and also found that the practices were racially discriminatory in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, The Bloomberg administration did appeal the ruling. The order was then suspended by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and the case was sent back to be tried again with a new judge presiding over the proceedings. However, the court shot down the city s motion and decided not to vacate Scheindlin s decision. The appeal was eventually dropped by the de Blasio administration.Trump, who has run a bigoted campaign right from the start, was completely undeterred by Holt s assertion of the facts and continued to argue vehemently in favor of the discriminatory policing practice.Watch Trump wrongly argue that  stop and frisk  wasn t ruled unconstitutional, even though it was, here:Featured image via video screen capture",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Lawyers for the Trump administration have served Facebook with three separate search warrants, demanding the private account information of users who could be described in their words as  anti-administration activists who have spoken out at organized events, and who are generally very critical of this administration s policies.  Read: Trump critics, and this has the potential to affect thousands of Facebook users.Fortunately, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a motion to quash the warrants on Thursday on behalf of three Facebook users. What is particularly chilling about these warrants is that anti-administration political activists are going to have their political associations and views scrutinized by the very administration they are protesting,  said ACLU attorney Scott Michelman.One such user is Emmelia Talarico. Talarico operated the disruptj20 page where other users could discuss and organize protests for Trump s Inauguration Day. If the search warrants are passed and Facebook is required to hand over the information, the government would have access to the identities of the estimated 6,000 users who visited the page. Talarico says if her account information were given to the government, officials would have access to her  personal passwords, security questions and answers, and credit card information,  plus  the private lists of invitees and attendees to multiple political events sponsored by the page. Facebook was first served the warrants back in February and they came with a gag order preventing the social media giant from alerting the three users in question about the government seeking their personal information. Michelman claims that government attorneys dropped the gag order earlier this month, allowing Facebook to expose the existence of the warrants, however, all court filings and any response from Facebook are still deemed confidential.The warrants also seek the personal information from the accounts of Lacy MacAuley and Legba Carrefour. Carrefour, a self-described political activist, acknowledges that he has participated in or helped to organize dozens of demonstrations and events of various types in service of political causes,  but is also concerned about the warrants because his Facebook account  contains a significant amount of private material concerning my personal life.

"Was this Somali immigrant refusing to appear in a ND court simply because he does not recognize American law? Or is it simply a case of believing he is entitled to special privileges because he is a  victim  of Islamaphobia in America? *UPDATE to story belowOriginal Story Dec 9, 2015A Muslim migrant who kidnapped a North Dakota woman and raped her while chanting  Allahu Akbar  has refused to appear in court.Abdulrahman Ali, a Somalian who arrived in America four years ago, is accused of sexually assaulting a gas station attendant in a bathroom at Gordy s Travel Plaza in Mapleton, North Dakota.After trying to kiss her, Ali allegedly forced the woman into the women s bathroom, locked the door behind him and started sexually molesting her while slapping and kicking the victim. When the woman tried to escape, Ali threw her against the wall. Documents say she was unsure if Ali was speaking English or a different language, but she could recognize one thing Ali said while they were in the bathroom alone. She heard Ali utter  Allah Akbar,  which, in Arabic means God is the greatest,  reports Valley News Live.Ali s sister responded to the arrest by claiming her brother was a  good person  but that he was suffering from mental health issues.Ali, who refused to face a judge, claiming he was sick, faces charges of gross sexual imposition, kidnapping, aggravated assault, and two counts of terrorizing.The report again underscores concerns that the west is importing a real rape culture via the influx of refugees and migrants from the Middle East and North Africa.Rapes occurring in and around migrant camps are now so prevalent, that authorities in Germany are covering up details of incidents so as not to  legitimize  critics of mass immigration.Via: Valley News Live*UPDATE- April 13, 2016 A Fargo man charged late last year with sexually assaulting a Mapleton store clerk appeared Wednesday, April 13, in Cass County District Court, but his case appears to be stalled for now as attorneys wait for a mental health exam.Abdulrahman Ibrahim Ali, 36, faces charges of gross sexual imposition, kidnapping, aggravated assault, and terrorizing stemming from an incident in December at Gordy s Travel Plaza in Mapleton. The most serious charge, Class AA felony gross sexual imposition, could carry a lifetime prison term if Ali were convicted.At one point Wednesday, Ali said he was having problems at the Cass County Jail and that he was taking medication but was not sleeping.Mental evaluations are used in criminal cases to assess whether a defendant is unable to assist in his own defense or was mentally ill or deficient at the time of the alleged crime. Either situation can prevent a defendant from standing trial.Ali s family has said he suffers from biploar disorder and that minor criminal charges against him in Ohio and Minnesota were dismissed on mental illness grounds.",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Do you think our Gun Grabber In Chief should be next?Virginia state senator Bill Carrico (R-Dist. 40) is responding to Governor Terry McAuliffe s (D) relentless gun control push by introducing a budget amendment to remove funding for McAuliffe s protection detail.Carrico said,  If he s so afraid of guns, then I m not going to surround him with armed state policemen. McAuliffe has pushed numerous gun controls as governor and, in August, infamously pushed for expanding background checks after Virginia reporter Alison Parker had been shot on air. McAuliffe made the push for expanded background checks before the gunman who killed Parker had been caught and, therefore, before he had any knowledge of how the gunman acquired his gun. As it turned out, gunman Vester Lee Flanagan acquired his gun via a background check.Moreover, on October 15, McAuliffe issued an executive order banning the open carry of firearms in state buildings used by the Virginia executive branch and calling for enforcement to ensure that the only people  in the business  of selling guns in Virginia are those with a Federal Firearm License (FFL).Senator Carrico is responding to these things and more by trying to be sure McAuliffe does not have to be around guns at all if they bother him so much. According to the Bristol Herald Courier, Carrico said he will address this matter when the General Assembly convenes in January, saying:A lot of the governor s power is deferred to the General Assembly at that point and I ll be getting with my colleagues to circumvent everything this governor has done on this point. I have a budget amendment that I m looking at to take away his executive protection unit. If he s so afraid of guns, then I m not going to surround him with armed state policemen.

"Manhattan is seeing significant problems due to Trump s insistence on staying in Trump Tower during his transition. He needs protection. His family needs protection. The tower needs protection. New York City is willing to give extensive help to the Secret Service to do it, but they can t afford it. And Mayor Bill DeBlasio is now asking the federal government for help.That help could be to the tune of $35 million, in addition to the ongoing costs of protecting Melania and Barron through the end of the school year, and the costs of Trump s need to go back to his tacky gilded penthouse as many weekends as he can. Thus far, the costs of protecting him in that tower are around $1 million per day.Now, sure, President Obama, Michelle and their daughters needed protection when they were in Chicago, Hawaii, etc. However, they didn t go back to Chicago or Hawaii nearly every weekend, and Obama took significantly fewer vacation days than George W. Bush.Trump is one of the people who got on Obama s case for the taxpayer cost of travels. He claimed that one of Obama s trips to New York City cost between $25 million and $50 million. Politifact rated that statement  Pants on Fire,  because the actual cost was considerably lower, and Trump, true to form, had no basis for his outlandish claim.McClatchy went after Obama for the price tag of his vacations, which was supposedly upwards of $70 million. Their number came from the right-wing group Judicial Watch. However, that report was published in Dec. 2015, and that cost was over the course of 7 years (it s important to note that the Obamas themselves paid for all their housing while they were away).In seven years, the Obamas cost us roughly twice what Trump is going to cost us over the next six weeks by insisting he remain in his poor man s idea of a rich man s apartment through his transition.Trump has pledged no long vacations. He doesn t count weekends in New York City or even at Mar a Lago, his Palm Beach resort, as vacations obviously, but those will add up pretty quickly in terms of taxpayer costs. A $35 million price tag just between now and January 20? Ridiculous.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Now that Donald Trump is president and Jeff Sessions is Attorney General, racist cops everywhere have free reign to abuse vulnerable groups of people at every turn. The latest incidence of said abuse was caught on tape by Brooklyn College Associate Professor of Sociology Alex S. Vitale, in which New York City police officers were seen telling a group of black students that they would use a taser on them if they didn t move away from the sidewalk. This is a definite abuse of authority, as the NYPD s official rules state that tasers are not to be used on minors.When the children were slow to move away from the sidewalk at the intersection of Bedford and Campus Avenue, one of the officers said, What are you going to do about it?  This apparently implies that the cops don t care about the children s rights, and would do as they please. A short time later, one cop asks the kids,  do you want to ride the lightning?  This appears to be slang for the use of a taser.Professor Vitale acknowledges that the actions of the officers on the video  seem [s] like an abuse of authority. Well, it certainly was abusive. Those children were not doing anything wrong. These cops are just looking to hurt black children because they can. They should be fired and charged with criminal offenses. Luckily, the kids involved in this incident weren t harmed, but, so many times, kids have wound up hurt or dead because racist, power-abusing cops decided to hurt them.The NYPD says that the actions of the officers on the tape are going to be investigated internally. Of course, that means nothing, because they are investigating themselves. They ll surely find that they have done nothing wrong, even though there is every indication, when one views that tape, that they ve done EVERYTHING wrong.Welcome to  community policing  in the age of Trump.Watch the disturbing video below:",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Radical Democratic Chair Tom Perez was being interviewed by MSNBC s Joy Reid about what Democrats need to do to ensure they win more seats in Congress. Joy Reid asked her viewers,  How do Democrats turn enthusiasm and better vibes, along with real anger at Donald Trump into the only thing that matters, winning elections?  Reid then turned to DNC Chair Tom Perez for answers. As Perez started to speak from a location in Portland Oregon, where he was appearing with Bernie Sanders for an event, viewers can see people in the background setting up for an apparent event. (Only Democrats would have people setting up their stage who have absolutely no respect for our American flag.) Watch the people tasked with setting up the Americans flags, as they drag the flag (on right side of the screen) across the ground before attempting to set it up. As the interview continues, it s only fitting that while Perez is talking about the email list Hillary Clinton gave the DNC from her campaign, that our American flag (after being dragged across the ground) would fall onto the stage. Perez goes on to discuss  Democratic values.  Sorry Tom, but for most of us who ve been witnessing the childish, violent and unAmerican behavior of Democrats following Hillary s loss to President Trump, we all became keenly aware of your  Democratic values.  When our American flag fell to the ground, almost on cue while mentioning Hillary s name that pretty much summed up your party.Here s the Perez interview in its entirety.

"Not many people would have guessed that a racist, misogynist, billionaire demagogue would be the nominee for the Republican Party for president of the United States. To the surprise and disgust of many, including the GOP establishment, (which by the way is quite funny to watch), Donald Trump today is the king of the Republican Party. But in all seriousness, how could such an individual now be so close to the most powerful position on the face of the planet? Stephen Colbert posed this question and looked to God for an answer. Colbert asked: God, I have a difficult question for you. God why did you let Donald Trump become the Republican nominee? God:  What? Shut the front door no way! You mean Trump the guy with the weird hair who sold steaks at the Sharper Image? Colbert: Yes  Haven t you been following the election? God:  Oh my god he s the worst. Stephen, I ve been pretty  busy to follow the election. I ve been dealing with a supernova, I have to decide who wins the NBA finals. What happened to Jeb? I thought he was a sure thing. What is with you people? Come on, I give you free will and you nominate a guy who looks like a microwave circus peanut? That s it, I m taking away your opposable thumbs.

"If you are or ever have been a member of the working poor, you have probably been screwed over by your bank. Maybe you were out of gas or milk or needed medicine and you didn t have enough money in your account, but you really, really needed something so you swiped your debit card and were hit with an overdraft fee   you are not alone. Millions of Americans are charged these fees, usually about $35 (in my experience). So many people are hit with these fees that they are very profitable for big banks. A new report has found that financial institutions made more than eleven billion dollars from these fees in 2015, alone.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)   established by Senator Elizabeth Warren in 2010   issued the report and found that 594 banks (worth more than $1 billion) fleeced the American people out of $11.16 billion last year.Some of the highlights the CFPB reported about overdraft and nonsufficient funds fees:Overdraft fees are one of the most predatory practices of big banks. Many of you have probably been hit by a bunch of overdraft fees at once. Say you go to the store and you buy that gallon of milk, but other transactions haven t cleared in your account yet. That gallon of milk may cause you to incur multiple overdraft fees because the banks use  fee-harvesting  software that reorganizes your transactions so that they can charge you multiple times.These shady practices are one of the reasons banks are now required to disclose their overdraft fee profits. Elizabeth Warren had a big role in these new rules because of her crusade to save the middle class and the working poor from Wall Street s love of exorbitant consumer fees. In 2012 Warren said: People enroll in overdraft programs to avoid bouncing checks, but too many of them get stuck owing hundreds of dollars in unexpected fees for services they never wanted and didn t know they had,  said Warren, one of the nation s experts on bankruptcy and consumer credit.   The new consumer agency is heading in the right direction to make sure that people have the tools and information they need to avoid these traps. The establishment of the CFPB has helped, in 2012 banks made three times as much ($32 billion) in fees from customers. But for the working class families who are struggling to survive, it s still not enough. We need real reform and banks because it is a huge problem when Wall Street s business model is  rob as many families as we possibly can.

"Eric Trump, in his first interview since his father Donald Trump was elected president, said on Sunday the Trump Organization plans to stop development of real estate projects overseas. In light of politics, we ve said  hey, listen, we re not going to expand anymore internationally. We re not going to do any new international projects.  And that was a big piece of what we did,  Trump, who is executive vice president of the organization, told Maria Bartiromo in an exclusive sitdown on  Sunday Morning Futures. Eric, along with older siblings Don Jr. and Ivanka, all have or have held positions within the family business prior to their father winning the presidential election. Once President Trump took office, he pledged to separate private interests from public policy. One way the president did this was by putting his holdings in a trust, managed by his sons and another executive from the company.Though no longer growing internationally for the time being, Trump explained how he finds the next growth spot in the real estate market, saying part of it is  gut  and  intuition. You see places that are reducing taxes, they re trying to incentivize businesses to come in. Those are always the places that do immensely well,  Trump said, citing Florida as a key example.""It's the right thing to do."" -Eric Trump announces Trump Organization will stop expanding overseas pic.twitter.com/BnN2TJYtrO  FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) March 20, 2017 They have low taxes, they ve got an incredible quality of life.

You certainly saw that in North Carolina, South Carolina and other states that really grew massively. Additionally, Trump explained how his father s pro-American business agenda has impacted the company, which has properties and deals all over the world. I don t think one and two are contrary to one another,  Trump said.  But I think when people abuse the system, they can be. I think the difference with us is we might do a project globally, but all the money comes back to the United States.  -Fox Business",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Pope Francis has once again infuriated conservatives after he washed and kissed the feet of Christian, Muslim, and Hindu   but most importantly Muslim   refugess on Thursday. In the ceremonial re-enactment of the foot-washing ritual Jesus performed on his disciples before he was crucified, the Pope again broke from the tradition of simply washing the feet of twelve Catholic men.In 2013, Francis washed the feet of women and Muslims at a juvenile detention center   a violation of longstanding rules he changed in January to allow all  people of God  to participate in the ritual. This shift from the patriarichal norm was not well-received by the American Right, but this year the Pope did something that sent conservatives into an irrational rage. To the Pope, who recognizes that Christians, Jews, and Muslims all worship the same God, this means anyone could be chosen to participate in the ritual.This year, four women and eight men participated. The women included an Italian Catholic and three Eritrean Coptic Christian migrants. The men included four Catholics from Nigeria and three Muslims from Mali, Syria, and Pakistan, and a Hindu man from India. If this broad mix wasn t enough to cause the Right to seethe with hatred, the Pope s words helped ensure it would happen:That s the sort of claim that has been known to get a Muslim woman removed from teaching at a Christian university, right there. It s a completely sensible statement.  Allah  is simply the Arabic translation of the word  God.  Unfortunately, combined with the fact that Francis performed an expression of humility with regard to Muslims caused the Right to flip the f*ck out. Conservatives flocked to the Washington Post s Facebook page to unleash their anger, frustration, and stupidity:           There are manufacturers, arms dealers who want blood, not peace; they want the war, not fraternity,  the Pope said after condemning the Brussels attack in statements prior to the ceremony. You, we, all of us together, of different religions, different cultures, but children of the same Father, brothers   and there, those poor people, who buy weapons to wreck fraternity. Today, at this time, when I do the same act of Jesus washing the feet of twelve of you, let us all make a gesture of brotherhood, and let us all say:  We are different, we are different, we have different cultures and religions, but we are brothers and we want to live in peace,'  he added   a message of unity that has been warmly embraced by all who do not believe that hatred is the way to go about living, but has managed to somehow irritate conservatives.Watch this deeply humble action, below:Featured image via screengrab",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

Sounds like a clear cut case of racism or something like that There was an uproar yesterday at the Wasserfahrt in Kl tze, Germany, as a minibus from the Altmark district passed by the new number 18 block of flats.Both of the caretakers of the emergency accommodation in Salzwedel brought a total of six people from Afghanistan, a couple with two children and the brother with his wife. They were to have temporary accommodation in Kl tze. But the Afghans refused to get off the bus. They just sat there. The reason: in the reception centre where they were housed during their flight, they had been promised a house. They insisted on this and refused to move into the home in the new block of flats.The two local council employees had no choice but to close the minibus doors and drive with both families back to Salzwedel. There the Afghans were housed once again in the sports hall at the Kollwitz school. In the afternoon, two interpreters tried to discuss the matter with the four adults and two children and explained the alternatives: Kl tze or the emergency accommodation.

This journey, led by forward-thinking individuals who have set their sights on reaching for a brighter tomorrow, has never been easy or smooth. The fight for dignity and equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people is reflected in the tireless dedication of advocates and allies who strive to forge a more inclusive society.

This month, we recognize all they have done to bring us to this point, and we recommit to bending the arc of our Nation toward justice.Last year s landmark Supreme Court decision guaranteeing marriage equality in all 50 States was a historic victory for LGBT Americans, ensuring dignity for same-sex couples and greater equality across State lines. For every partnership that was not previously recognized under the law and for every American who was denied their basic civil rights, this monumental ruling instilled newfound hope, affirming the belief that we are all more free when we are treated as equals.

"We re still waiting for the NFL to make a statement about the disrespectful protests by multi-millionaire players who plan to protest an  oppressive  America and the cops who defend the stadiums, keeping fans and players safe while they play football on 9-11 Even as the NFL turns a blind eye to the lengthening list of players protesting America by refusing to stand for the national anthem, the league has decided to crack down on a player who announced his intention to wear cleats to memorialize the vicious terror attacks on September 11, 2001. Now a police union is vowing to pay the player s NFL fine if he ll wear them despite the league s punishment.The NFL has officially banned Tennessee Titans linebacker Avery Williamson from wearing cleats custom made as a memorial to the victims and first responders who fell in the line of duty during that terrible day on 9/11.In response the disappointed Williamson announced that instead of wearing them during Sunday s game with the Minnesota Vikings he would auction them off with the proceeds going to benefit Operation Warrior Wishes.But after hearing of the NFL s denial of Williamson s request to honor the fallen, two police unions stepped forward pledging to pay what would be a $6,000 NFL fine if the player ignored the league s demands and wore them anyway.For his part, the player said he doesn t want to cause anyone any trouble and just wanted to do a nice thing for the country. I don t want to draw negative attention, so I m just going to focus on playing the game,  Williamson said of the ban on the cleats.  Once I heard from them, I didn t even try to argue anything. I just left it alone. I didn t want to press the issue. The shoes Williamson calls his  patriot cleats  are blue with red- and white-striped Nike swooshes featuring the words  Never Forget  and  9/11  on the back. Also a number  11  representing the Twin Towers appear. The shoes were airbrushed by True Blue Customs in Lexington, Kentucky.In its denial the NFL reminded Williamson that all teams must be uniform on the field and no single player may wear unauthorized gear or sport special decorations upon that gear. The ban is usually aimed at keeping unauthorized financial sponsorships from appearing on field.This isn t the first time the NFL has denied a player s request to honor police or first responders, even as other players are permitted to indulge protests against the U.S.A. and support for Black Lives Matter.Only last month the NFL refused to allow the Dallas Cowboys to wear decals on their helmets showing support for the Dallas Police Department, which lost five officers in one terrible attack in July.The  Arm In Arm  decal was to have been worn when the team opened its preseason schedule during a game with the Los Angeles Rams.For entire story: Breitbart News",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

"Only days after the worst mass shooting in the nation s history happened against the LGBT community, the GOP decided they could go back to being discriminatory.One would think they d wait at least a week, but apparently three days seemed long enough to mourn the loss of those who perished at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, because according to Vanity Fair:Republican leaders in the House of Representatives blocked a vote on a proposal that would ensure federal contractors can t discriminate against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identification.That s right, you read that correctly, they seem to think it s perfectly acceptable for federal contractors to be able to fire someone for being gay.According to The Hill:Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), who is gay, filed an amendment to a Defense Department spending bill that would enforce a 2014 executive order prohibiting discrimination against LGBT people.Yet, the House Rules Committee didn t see it worthy of consideration and wouldn t even allow it to be voted upon. Nope, not even a vote. Not even a chance.Apparently, the House GOP doesn t want anything added to the annual spending bills for fear that it may inhibit passage. You know, because adding non-discriminatory amendments for LGBT people in a House of Representatives full of GOP bigots doesn t go over well and could clog up business as usual.As The Hill explains:House GOP leaders decided to clamp down on amendments to annual spending bills after Maloney s proposal threatened passage of other appropriations measures last month. Before now, Republicans had been considering appropriations bills under a procedure allowing members of either party to offer unlimited amendments.Don t you see, they only want to play by their rules. If you re not doing something they like, well, then they will make sure it never happens, but guaranteed if it was the other way around, the story would be verrrry different.This just proves, yet again, that Republicans only care about themselves.Featured Photo by Allison Shelley/Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

In an exclusive interview with Yahoo News at the president s office in Damascus, Assad said President Trump s freeze on refugees into his country   part of an executive order that has drawn widespread protests and is being challenged in federal court    is an American issue  on which he would not take sides. But asked if some of those who fled are  aligned with terrorists,  Assad quickly replied,  Definitely. What is clear from this interview is that the President Assad has a much deeper and more realistic understanding of the real threat of terrorism, and the causes of terrorism   far and away beyond the shallow, childish rhetoric we hear on a daily basis from those US officials still openly supporting radical Islamist terrorists in Syria like US Senators like John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Bob Corker and other who are still clinging to the fictional narrative of the  moderate rebel  in Syria. It is also clear that Assad has a much more intelligent handle on the concept of  safe zones  than the Trump Administration so far, as well as a better understanding of the totality of refugee issue, who Assad said is partly fuelled by the crippling sanctions imposed by the US.

"New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman isn t going to allow Donald Trump s 2016 presidential campaign get in the way of his ongoing prosecution of the GOP frontrunner for  fraud. Schneiderman is the highest profile government official looking into Trump s shady business dealings at Trump University. Customers claim that after they signed up for the opportunity, they were pressured to spend ever-increasing amounts of money with little knowledge of the real estate business to show for it.In an interview with ABC, the attorney general explained that he s not going to back off. We re ready to go,  Schneiderman, a Democrat, told ABC News today.  We sued him long before anyone thought he might run for President. This is not a political case, it s just a straight-up fraud case. Like the judge also looking into the case, Scneiderman has come in for attack by Trump, who has used his high profile to impugn the prosecutor s motives. But that hasn t dissuaded the prosecutor.Schneiderman told ABC News he is not worrying about the confluence of the campaign and his case. The documents, he said only served to offer further proof that the operation was aimed less at teaching students the skills needed to buy and sell real state, and more about making money for Trump. It was clearly a way to separate people who were desperate to make money in hard economic times from their own cash and to get it into the pocket of Mr. Trump and his cronies,  Schneiderman said.The secret Trump University documents have revealed that workers at the operation were given a step-by-step manual on how to convince prospective  students  to give the company access to their money and also explained how to prey on their emotions in pursuit of profits. Trump University is now defunct, after Trump and his partners made money off of regular people, all while egging students on to profit from the 2007-8 real estate collapse.Featured image via YouTube",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"These social justice warriors always think they know what s best for you and everyone else. Social justice is socialism so perhaps the White House press is correct. It s easy to spread the wealth with other people s money Pope Francis and President Obama have both dedicated their lives to helping the less fortunate, and that commonality will be central to their meeting Wednesday during the pope s first visit to the United States, a White House spokesman said hours before Obama left to greet the pontiff as he landed at Andrews Air Force Base Tuesday afternoon. Both men have talked, quite publicly, about their commitment to social justice,  White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in previewing their Oval Office meeting scheduled for Wednesday morning.  And both men have dedicated their, not just their careers, but their lives, to that effort. Certainly the kind of commitment that we ve seen from Pope Francis is unique and singular,  Earnest allowed  but I think the values that both men live out have some common ground.

Trump told Fox that he will take away every penny that California receives from the federal government.The state of California has one of the ten largest economies in the world. Not only is it a giant among states, competing with the economies of some of the most affluent countries worldwide, but it is one of the few states that pays more into the federal Treasury than it receives in government funding. It would be a huge mistake to put the state of California in a position that legislators may decide to stop paying taxes altogether, but Donald Trump seems determined to do just that because, well, he s an idiot. If we have to, we ll defund,  he said.  We give tremendous amounts of money to California. Thanks to the state s liberal policies, California has outpaced the rest of the nation on job growth and had a gross state product of 2.46 trillion in 2015, placing it sixth behind the United Kingdom in world economies (ranked by Gross Domestic Product) and 11th in the world ranked by cost of living.In other words, California would be fine without the federal money it receives if the state stopped paying taxes to the federal government. Officials are currently looking into doing exactly that if Trump follows through on his threat to take federal funding from the state. California could very well become an organized non-payer,  if Trump follows through on threats to punish cities and states that do not comply with requests to turn over Jews undocumented immigrants to Trump s goons, a former speaker of the state Assembly told KPIX 5 on Sunday.  They could recommend non-compliance with the federal tax code. I don t want to defund the state or city, I don t want to defund anybody, I want to give them the money they need to properly operate a city or a state,  Trump says, but  if they re going to have sanctuary cities we may have to do that   certainly that would be a weapon. Ir would be a weapon, but the federal government needs California s money more than the state needs funding from the government. This fact alone is enough to virtually assure that lawmakers will choose to defund Trump rather than violate their conscience and hand over people Trump has deemed  undesirable. Looks like Trump s threat has been called. It s time to find out if he is really stupid enough to try this kind of stunt.Read more:Featured image via Getty Images (Drew Angerer)",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"You know all those fears conservatives dismiss that Trump is going to get us into another world war? Well, those concerns are very real based on what he just said at a press conference in Seoul, South Korea. It s time to act with urgency and with great determination,  Trump said during the press conference.  North Korea is a worldwide threat that requires worldwide action. We call on every responsible nation including China and Russia to demand that the North Korean regime end its nuclear weapons and its missile programs,  The Donald said. The United States stands prepared to defend itself and its allies using the full range of our unmatched military capabilities if need be,  Trump said, desperately trying to  wag the dog  in an effort to distract from the mounting criminal indictments of his associates.Is it any wonder that seemingly more South Koreans showed up to protest Trump than Americans attended his inauguration? Trump is getting desperate, and it seems that he has decided a war is the way to go if he wants to escape from the situation he has put himself in unscathed.Watch Trump tell the world he ll kill us all to distract from his bullsh*t below:US President Trump: North Korea is a worldwide threat that requires worldwide action https://t.co/EQixZGcdRR pic.twitter.com/z6BToFOUQP  CNN International (@cnni) November 7, 2017Featured image via screengrab",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"If Donald Trump had been at Madison Square Garden during this Marc Anthony concert, he would have been booed out of the building.During the concert, the popular Latino singer took aim at the Republican billionaire by shouting at the top of his lungs about his pride at being a Latino before telling Trump to go f*ck himself, which drew a loud cheer from the thousands in attendance. I m proud to be a Latino,  Anthony told his fans. I just want to say, we re proud of our country. We speak a little differently. We have our own food, we have our own way of being. But here, no matter where you come from, we re Latinos. And we have to take care of each other, no matter where we come from. There s only one f*cking box to check when you come to this country, and it says  Latino!' There s some crazy movement coming from some  Anthony began to say while motioning with his hands. He then wanted to say two things. First,  F*ck Donald Trump!  Anthony then told the crowd that he wants Trump to hear it from his house.  Wake that motherf*cker up.  And then the concert resumed.Here s the video via YouTube.It s understandable why Anthony has a problem with Donald Trump. Throughout his run for the presidency, Trump has repeatedly launched unfair attacks on Latinos. During his official campaign announcement Trump characterized all Mexicans as rapists, and promised to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep Latino immigrants from entering the country. Ever since, he has blamed Latinos for the crime and violence in the United States and called for a renewal of  Operation Wetback,  a deportation initiative under the Eisenhower Administration, a consequence of which resulted in the use of  wetback  as a derogatory term against Latinos and the displacement of thousands of men, women, and children.The fact is that, like Donald Trump, Marc Anthony is an American citizen and a native New Yorker. But while Trump clings to a racist version of America, Anthony believes in the historical diversity that has made America great over countless generations.That being said, Republicans should tread carefully if they really want Latinos to vote for their candidate in November. After all, 70 percent of Latinos voted for President Obama in 2012. If the GOP doesn t stop being racist, they can expect even more Latinos to vote against them this time around.

"Donald Trump is currently steamrolling his way to victory and Republicans seem to finally be waking up to the nightmare that he s going to win the nomination whether they want him to or not.One man who clearly has no problem with swallowing his pride and giving into Trump mania is current New Jersey governor and former Republican candidate for president, Chris Christie. On Friday, he announced that of all the candidates left, Trump is the one who most represents his values. Which actually makes a lot of sense, right? Donald and I have been friends for over a decade,  Christie said. The Republican governor, who dropped out from the race himself after the New Hampshire primary, called Trump a  clear standout  who can provide  strong, unequivocal leadership. What exactly does Christie mean by  strong, unequivocal leadership ? Bullying.It s a strange, twisted irony that Chris Christie saw his election chances dwindle to zero because the brash, quick-to-anger, petty governor was outdone by Trump, a man who could do all of those things, only infinitely better than Christie himself. Christie was planning on running on his record of bullying teachers and union employees, screaming at constituents and attacking political rivals with underhanded tactics. That was supposed to, in Republican terms, make him look  tough  and  capable.  But then Trump came along   a guy who had no problem telling his fans to physically beat up protesters. Who bragged about being able to kill a person in broad daylight. Who used any slight   real or imagined   to viciously go after his opponents in ways that were ugly, even for Washington. Trump is the man Christie wishes he could be.But it s a two-way street. No doubt, Christie s endorsement will help Trump solidify his place as the real front-runner in the race. Christie is considered an  establishment Republican  and his support of Trump legitimizes the former reality television star. It also helps that Christie, before he bowed out, single-handedly destroyed Marco Rubio during a debate. Now that Rubio is running at a distance second place to Trump, Christie can serve as an ever-present reminder of that surreal Robot Rubio software glitch moment.Notice in the wake of the endorsement, nothing is being said of Christie s integrity -that s simply because Christie has none. The man will gladly bash Obama to earn votes then give him a hug when he comes to save his state from a natural disaster. Then he ll go right back to bashing him. Likewise, for months, Christie told voters that Trump was a dangerous and unserious candidate. Now, he throws his reputation behind him, happy to ride his coattails all the way to a cabinet position in a Trump White House.Opportunistic, self-serving and two-faced, it s like Christie was born to endorse Trump. They have so much in common.Featured image via YouTube screenshot",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"It was only a matter of time before this happened. The very first instance of an American presidential candidate in the modern age dropping the f-bomb during a stump speech occurred this week. And, naturally, it was Donald Trump who broke through the taboo then backed over it just to make sure it s dead.Indeed, Trump let fly with the f-word on Friday during one of his stream-of-consciousness rants that pass for stump speeches. And, frankly, I don t know whether to scowl or cheer. In spite of Trump s general awfulness, I m leaning  cheer. We re gonna bring businesses back. We re gonna have businesses that used to be in New Hampshire, that are now in Mexico, come back to New Hampshire, and you can tell them to go f*ck themselves! Because they let you down, and they left![youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr-_Nwi2FyY&w=560&h=315]Yes, let s tell corporations that send jobs to places like Mexico and China to go f*ck themselves.

We can t say it on non-pay cable or on the radio   or on websites because advertisers don t like it   but we can show unspeakable scenes of violence and other horrors all the time. There s something perverse and unjust about that. So, in that regard, Trump can feel free to let the expletives fly. But if he s elected, I wonder if his FCC appointees will be equally lenient. On the other hand, Trump s use of  f*ck  is another step away from presidential decorum on the Republican side, and one step closer to amateur-hour composed of reality show hacks running for the highest office in the land. I m honestly torn.For the record, Trump has said  f*ck  in public before, but not during a presidential stump speech.Featured image via video screen grab.",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"According to Bedford, Mass. School Superintendent, John Sills, no employees will face disciplinary action for showing this video to the students. People who are sick and tired of watching our nation being divided down racial lines should call him at 781-275-7588. It s time to flood the lines of these leftist school administrators and let him know how you feel about the shaming of white students in a high school he is paid to supervise.BEDFORD, Mass.   After students played a video promoting racial stereotypes during the morning announcements, school administrators are dismissing it as a  teachable moment. A group of students at Bedford High School who produce  BHS Live  created a video called  Sh*t White People Say,  which played off racial stereotypes allegedly held by their white peers.It featured a black girl wearing a blonde wig, several school employees and a number of minority students.It warns white students to  DO NOT ASSume  things about their black classmates. I m very offended by what I saw,  parent Bob Marshall tells Fox 25.  It was a very disgusting video, very hurtful video. A lot of them were upset by what they saw,  Marshall he says of students who watched it during morning announcements. I m shocked that a video like that could be displayed and that nobody oversaw it. School administrators are pleading ignorance.HERE S THE VIDEO:In a letter home to parents after the incident, the school s principal says,     there has not been a vetting process of videos for BHS Live. Therefore, the video was not previewed by any administrator, student or teacher surrounding BHS Live. A protocol for vetting student videos is being developed. That seems a little hard to believe, given that three adults participated in the production.Superintendent John Sills says while  it was framed in a way that was offensive,  it was a positive thing that the video spurred  conversations. I would never say it s good when something offensive happens. But we always seek to find positives, and we continue to work to derive learning from it,  according to Sills.That s not good enough for Marshall. To me, it s smoke and mirrors to say oh, it was a learning lesson,  Marshall says.  Somebody needs to be held accountable and somebody needs to lose their job over it. According to the superintendent, no employees will face disciplinary action.Via: EAG News",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"In an effort to prepare his supporters for the upcoming Republican primary, Ted Cruz urged them to put on their  armor of God  and not believe any bad things people say about him. I want to tell everyone to get ready, strap on the full armor of God, get ready for the attacks that are coming,  Cruz said according to the Washington Post.Cruz leads in some Iowa polls over Donald Trump and has seen a rise in national polls despite the fact that his religious zealotry is a huge threat to our democracy and Constitution.And that s why he is telling his fanatics to cover their ears and refuse to believe or even consider any attacks made against him, even if they might be true. Unfortunately, there are a lot of folks in politics who are not constrained by what they view as quaint notions of the truth,  Cruz continued. They believe particularly as you get close to an election day, that they can just toss out any lie, any attack and the attack will do its damage before anyone discovers that it s not true. So I want everyone here to get ready, because that is coming, and it s coming with a ferocity none of us has ever seen. Cruz claims that establishment Republicans are trying to sabotage his campaign by telling lies about him. In reality, the only lies being told are the ones coming from Cruz s own mouth.Like when he was caught in a lie last month on live television during an appearance on Fox News while claiming that he didn t want an immigration bill to pass in the Senate, which didn t match up with previous statements he has made.Or how about when Cruz was outed as a complete hypocrite on CNN when Dana Bash pointed out that he wouldn t be running for president today had the United States not granted asylum to his father. In fact, he may not have ever existed since Cruz s father would have likely been killed in Cuba if the United States government had succumbed to fears over Communism being spread by immigrants.And then there s the time Cruz claimed that Christians do not commit acts of terrorism, conveniently ignoring the KKK, anti-abortion lunatics, Timothy McVeigh and multiple mass shootings that have occurred in recent years.Ted Cruz is basically treating his supporters like a cult leaders treat their followers. He is telling them to ignore what is said outside the campaign and is using religious rhetoric to gin them up into a frenzy. He wants them to believe that he is a divine leader sent by God to rule the country like a king, which is literally what an Iowa Republican actually does believe.Facts and truth do not matter to Ted Cruz. He only wants people to believe what he tells them to believe. And if he does win, theocracy will replace our democracy as the Bible replaces our Constitution.Featured Image: YouTube/ Wikimedia",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"The NRA has a new favorite toy, but there are no bullets involved   except maybe the bullet points they include in their scripts. Dana Loesch has transformed herself from useful Fox News idiot to darling of the Second Amendment, and the NRA is more than happy to put her stern but beautiful face on camera.Earlier this year, Loesch and the NRA put out a video recruiting ad they called  The Clenched Fist of Truth.  It accused the left of  assassinating real news  and using wedge issues like homophobia, racism, and sexism to stifle the views of conservative Americans. In the video, schoolchildren are depicted on a playground just before Loesch says they re being indoctrinated to believe Trump is  another Hitler.  In short, it s disgusting. Civil rights activist DeRay McKesson summed it up:This NRA ad is an open call to violence to protect white supremacy. If I made a video like this, I'd be in jail. pic.twitter.com/LD65yMUMVn  deray mckesson (@deray) June 29, 2017But the backlash was short-lived, and in an environment as rich with news as the Trump era, it was quickly forgotten, despite its gross, dangerous message.Now Dana and the NRA are back with a new ad, equally violent, this time aimed at the New York Times. Loesch carefully phrases her threats as a shot across the  proverbial  bow of the Times, so as to avoid being accused of outright incitement. But the accusations in the video mirror perfectly the paranoia, suspicion, and resentment of Trump fans who want to believe that news they don t like is  fake.  And the final phrase in the video    We re coming for you    is as menacing as anything else the NRA has done.In a near-derailing of the conversation, a few pundits misheard Loesch s use of the word Fisk (a  verb-ing  of the last name of a writer considered easily debunked by right-wingers who disagree with him), thinking instead that she had said  fist.  If that seems like a silly thing to get hung up on, the context clears it up:We re going to fisk the New York Times and find out just what deep rich means to this old gray hag.If you thought that said  fist,  the meaning is changed considerably. Their mistake wasn t just one of hearing, though   the tweet from the NRA accompanying the video uses the hashtag #ClenchedFistOfTruth. The mistake is understandable. Loesch didn t think so: She blew up at a few notable tweeters who made the error.The new, Orwellian video says, in part:We ve had it with your constant protection of your Democrat overlords, your refusal to acknowledge any truth that upsets the fragile construct that you believe is real life.Somebody is confused about what s real and what s not   and it s not the New York Times.Watch the video here:.@DLoesch has a message for the @nytimes:  We're coming for you.

"Some great news on the carbon emissions rule! The Supreme Court agreed to stop enforcement until legal challenges are resolved. This power grab is something that s not good on any level and in spite of the statement that it would create job it s a job killer! Just ask anyone connected to the coal industry.A divided Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to halt enforcement of President Barack Obama s sweeping plan to address climate change until after legal challenges are resolved.The surprising move is a blow to the administration and a victory for the coalition of 27 mostly Republican-led states and industry opponents that call the regulations  an unprecedented power grab. By temporarily freezing the rule the high court s order signals that opponents have made a strong argument against the plan. A federal appeals court last month refused to put it on hold.The court s four liberal justices said they would have denied the request.The plan aims to stave off the worst predicted impacts of climate change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions at existing power plants by about one-third by 2030.Appellate arguments are set to begin June 2.The compliance period starts in 2022, but states must submit their plans to the Environmental Protection Administration by September or seek an extension.Many states opposing the plan depend on economic activity tied to such fossil fuels as coal, oil and gas. They argued that power plants will have to spend billions of dollars to begin complying with a rule that may end up being overturned.Implementation of the rules is considered essential to the United States meeting emissions-reduction targets in a global climate agreement signed in Paris last month.Read more: CNBC",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

Hillary for New Hampshire is looking for smart, energetic winter fellows who are committed to winning the New Hampshire primary for Hillary Clinton,  read the email from a campaign staffer.  Everyone working on the campaign now started off as a fellow at some point so it is a great way of getting a different skill set whilst helping an important cause. Tim and Elita Galvin were furious that their teenage son had received the solicitation   calling it  disingenuous and sneaky. My son didn t appreciate being targeted by anybody via his school email for a political campaign,  Mrs. Galvin told me.  I ll be honest   he s not a fan of Hillary Clinton to begin with. He s done his homework and he doesn t like her. The Galvins reached out to Paul Mehlhorn, the principal of the high school. They provided me with a copy of his emailed response. We often receive information from outside sources regarding opportunities for students to get involved in their communities,  he wrote.  We pass on this information to provide students with ways they may meet the requirement to perform 50 hours of community service to graduate. Mehlhorn went on to explain that students are not obligated to volunteer for Clinton s campaign,  nor does it suggest the school supports a particular political candidate, religious doctrine or branch of military. If other  campaigns  were to seek volunteers, we would pass that on also,  he noted.The principal went to say that the email solicitation sounded like a great way to have a conversation with their children about understanding their choices in getting involved or not.As you might imagine, Mr. and Mrs. Galvin were not all that thrilled with the principal s explanation.

Those activities were spun off in 2010 and are now managed by the Clinton Health Access Initiative, a completely separate non-profit organization.

The far-right white supremacist just did a rare interview with The New York Times, which is ironic considering how much he seems to hate the press, and he took the opportunity to paint the press as an incompetent enemy. In that interview, he said, point-blank: The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while. Listen to what? More of Trump s lies? The press should let his lies go unchallenged? Just for the record, the press does not like being told they can t challenge public figures.

"21st Century Wire says..We ll believe it  when, and if we are even allowed to see it (redacted) Mary Clare Jalonick AP/All GovWASHINGTON   The Senate on Tuesday backed legislation to make it easier for Americans to obtain government records.The bipartisan bill, passed by voice vote, would require federal agencies to consider the release of government information under  a presumption of openness  as opposed to a presumption that the information is secret.The legislation aims to reduce the amount of exemptions the government uses to withhold information and would create a single portal through which individuals can submit a Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, request. Currently, FOIA requests are handled by each separate agency, each with its own rules about how to submit a request. Today s vote sends a clear message that the American people have a fundamental right to know what their government is doing,  Cornyn said.( ) We cannot leave it to the next president to decide how open the government should be,  Leahy said.  We have to hold all presidents and their administrations accountable to the highest standard. Republicans in Congress have complained that the Obama administration hasn t been fully transparent in sharing records with lawmakers and the public, while the White House has criticized Congress for exempting itself from the requirements. FOIA does not apply to Congress.The House passed a similar bill in January. Because the two bills are not identical, the House will have to act again to send the legislation to President Barack Obama. Maryland Rep. Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, urged Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to promptly pass the Senate bill, saying FOIA reform is long overdue Continue this story at All GovREAD MORE FOIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire FOIA Files",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"House Speaker Paul Ryan is nothing but a spineless weasel. Earlier in the GOP Primary season, he seemed to actually have a bit of common decency   not to mention common sense   when he called out Trump for refusing to disavow an endorsement from a white supremacist, and when he outright said that he was not comfortable endorsing Trump. However, as it became increasingly clear that Trump was not to be stopped, Ryan started preparing to back off his attacks on the billionaire mogul by having meetings with him   clearly a preparation for an endorsement. Now, that day has come, as Speaker Ryan has officially said that he is prepared to vote for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.Ryan s hometown newspaper, The Gazette, ran a column where the House Speaker announced his support for Trump. Ryan wrote in the column that he has been speaking with Trump, and is somehow now comfortable endorsing him, when such a short time ago he clearly was not. He wrote in the column: Through these conversations, I feel confident he (Trump) would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve people s lives. That s why I ll be voting for him this fall. He went on to say: But the reality is, on the issues that make up our agenda, we have more common ground than disagreement. But of course, at the core of Ryan s reasoning for endorsing a dangerous, racist narcissist for the position of leader of the free world is the fact that the GOP is putting party before country, and ultimately if they stop Clinton, they re just fine with Trump in the White House. Ryan went on to warn of what would happen if Clinton beat Trump: A Clinton White House would mean four more years of liberal cronyism and a government more out for itself than the people it serves. Quite simply, she represents all that our agenda aims to fix. And that s really what it s all about. Paul Ryan is willing to let Donald Trump literally destroy America with his hateful ideas and dangerous policy proposals and willingness to sever ties with our most important allies in order to not have a truly qualified president because he disagrees with her politically.And to top off just how absolutely spineless this man is, he had his speech uploaded to The Gazette s website during Hillary Clinton s big, anti-Trump foreign policy speech   clearly in the hopes that nobody would notice what he has done.Shame on you, Speaker Ryan. Hopefully, this is the end of your political career. One can certainly hope.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Scott Baio made an appearance on Fox Business where the actor and Donald Trump supporter insinuated that President Obama is a Muslim and a terrorist sympathizer. Baio said during the interview: I can t tell whether he is dumb, a Muslim, or a Muslim sympathizer   I don t think he is dumb. Chachi s  Muslim sympathizer  comment is particularly troubling. It seems that what he meant to say is that President Obama is a  terrorist sympathizer.  I m not entirely sure what a  Muslim sympathizer  is, though I have to admit I feel particularly sympathetic towards the 1.6 billion Muslims out there who are not violent terrorists but are still demonized by xenophobic right-wingers such as Baio. I don t know what the endgame is for liberals to continue these policies. . . Is it to totally eliminate the United States as it was created and founded and as it is now? It s hard to tell exactly what policies Baio is talking about. He mentions that Hillary Clinton wants to increase something by 500% so we can assume he is talking about immigration. Though that statistic is completely absurd. In fact, more immigrants have been deported under Obama than any other president in the history of the United States by far. These mass deportations are one of the major criticisms the left has had of the Obama administration. It is one part of Obama s legacy that very few people on the left would hope to see in his successor. However, this is a segment on Fox Business, so facts like that are not mentioned.Baio goes on to say that Democrats only get angry over guns and Republicans, yet do not get angry over terrorism. That is of course nonsense. The left is furious that the NRA has taken our nation hostage, making it possible for terrorists to purchase assault weapons in a matter of minutes, then use those weapons to massacre huge numbers of people. The left also is pretty furious that Muslims are demonized by the right and the media for acts of terror and hatred despite the fact that terrorism is routinely perpetrated by members of all religions.You can watch the segment below.Featured image from screenshot via YouTube",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

"If you listened to Republicans and conservatives, you would probably believe that  voter fraud  is running rampant across America, as dead voters and other illegal votes rise up and jam polling places from coast to coast, winning elections for Democrats at all levels as poor Republicans sit and look on, completely helpless before the onslaught.But as is so often the case with a lot Republican hysteria, voter fraud claims are at best a tiny, minuscule, whimper, and not the national emergency you would assume it is based on Fox News and the rest. The New York Times looked into it after the 2016 election, and they found nothing:In an election in which more than 137.7 million Americans cast ballots, election and law enforcement officials in 26 states and the District of Columbia   Democratic-leaning, Republican-leaning and in-between   said that so far they knew of no credible allegations of fraudulent voting. Officials in another eight states said they knew of only one allegation.[ ]But inquiries to all 50 states (every one but Kansas responded), found no states that reported indications of widespread fraud. And while additional allegations could surface as states wind up postelection reviews, their conclusions are unlikely to change significantly.The reality is, as far as statistics go, voter fraud may as well not exist it is such a small portion of the vote. Yet it is repeatedly invoked by conservative Republicans to pass measures such as voter ID and limits on early voting.Why? Because  voter fraud  is an excuse and a smoke screen for Republican initiatives designed to cut down on the minority vote, particularly black Americans. It is also used to limit voter registration among young voters. Those segments have been targeted by the right for suppression because they vote overwhelmingly in favor of Democrats.Conservatives believe that the best way to win an election is to stop certain key voting blocs from having their votes counted. And the phony  voter fraud  is a great way to get that to happen.Featured image via Flickr",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"It gets creepier and creepier with Ted Cruz. This time, he took Ben Carson, who s not exactly the model presidential candidate either, along for the ride as the two held a secret meeting in   yes   a storage closet.The strange meeting was called for by Ted Cruz ahead of the Conservative Review convention Thursday  in order to mend fences with Carson and improve his image ahead of the South Carolina primary. The two cuddled in the closet for more than 20 minutes as Secret Service agents stood outside.Carson has spent weeks attacking Cruz for spreading false rumors that Carson had dropped out of the presidential race during the Iowa Caucuses. Cruz won Iowa but not before unleashing a storm over his questionable antics, which have not only eroded his already creepy reputation but have seen him dip in polls after a strong Iowa showing.Carson s campaign confirmed that Carson had agreed to meet Cruz but blamed the leak about the meeting on Cruz and his campaign. They accused the Cruz campaign of leaking the meeting in order to give the impression there were no longer any hard feelings between the two candidates. Should Carson be surprised at Cruz s sleaziness at this point?The meeting, which took place in a storage closet next to a bathroom ended with Carson saying, we agree to disagree. We disagree on accountability and culpability. In a sign that the meeting was leaked before it actually happened, reporters were already calling the Carson campaign as the two met.  It lasted for more than the five minutes Carson originally agreed to and Carson s people had to knock on the door to get him out because he was about to speak. According to a Republican operative, the meeting did not go like Cruz had planned: There was a political play there and it didn t work for them. The meeting didn t go as well as Cruz wanted it to go. Carson had a smile on his face and was looking right at him. There s no doubt that Cruz s lies are catching up to him, and it s only a matter of time before he ll drop out of the race and his run will be in the dustbin of history.

There is a noticeable trend toward increasing repressive activities of this kind,  the CCDHRN said in its monthly report.  At the same time, we also identify 95 cases of people who suffered other forms of political repression including physical attacks, police harassment and vandalism and hostile demonstrations. The exercise of all civil and political rights is still a crime,  the group said, noting that the Cuban penal code still includes an offense called  pre-criminal social dangerousness,  which is punishable by up to four years in prison.The country is unlikely to see an improvement in respect for fundamental, civil and political rights  as a result of the government s inflexible posture and its opposition to any effort or proposal leading to the urgent judicial, economic and political reforms that the Cuban people need and deserve,  the commission said.

"In a sorry attempt to smear the protester who allegedly threatened Trump with a sign in Reno, people are already working on creating fake connections for Austyn Crites, who didn t even have the gun the Trumpkins at the Reno rally claimed. Since the original story disintegrated before their eyes, they re now turning to other, ahem, methods to show that Hillary was really behind Crites  non-assassination attempt.Crites is a #NeverTrumper, but is still a Republican and has no ties to Hillary that anyone s aware of. Nevertheless, Trump is among the first who tried to paint him as such by asking how much Hillary had paid him to protest at his rally. That was just before he told his people to get Crites out of there.There are stories floating around claiming that, because Crites  name has been mentioned on Wikileaks, he must be a paid Hillary shill. Nobody could ever possibly show up on the joke that is Wikileaks if they re not connected to Hillary in some way, right? Right. Ha.    Crites  name apparently does show up on Wikileaks, but even this right-wing site says they re not in connection with any of Podesta s emails. Rather, he shows up in connection with a company called Stratfor, which is a global intelligence agency The Atlantic characterizes as  just The Economist a week later and several hundred times more expensive. Yet Wikileaks claims that Stratfor is a front for a global network of shadowy informants and spies, and even publishes its  payment laundering scheme  for those people. The truth is that Stratfor is, more or less, a joke among analysts and others who actually know what s going on in the world, and their methods of information gathering are no different than journalistic methods.In other words, in reporting this, Wikileaks appears desperate to The Atlantic, and the people screaming  SMOKING HILLARY GUN!!  because Crites  name appears in a few Wikileaks dumps are just as pitifully desperate.They don t care, though. They re going about their task of  exposing  the connection between Trump s  assassin  and Hillary with all the gleeful abandon there is in the badly misinformed, paranoid extremist.Mediaite also found evidence that these poor, desperate souls are creating fake profiles for Austyn Crites trying to link him to Hillary. The one that they screencapped is a little too obvious to be serious because it lists him as a money launderer for the Clinton Foundation and a paid protester for the DNC. It also claims he studied Civil Disobedience at the University of Chicago s Booth School of Business.They re getting just flat out ridiculous now, especially given that James Comey just crushed their hopes of any indictment against Hillary over new emails, and the Secret Service destroyed their dreams of proving that Hillary s hiring people to murder Donald Trump.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images ",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Are you paying attention America? A vote for Hillary is a vote for communist billionaire, and chaos financier George Soros.

He and Hillary will ALWAYS put themselves and their massive fortunes before the little people. Isn t it time to elect someone who really cares about America?Watch Hillary boldly proclaim,  We are going to follow the money! Meanwhile back to reality:Billionaire investor George Soros has re-emerged this election cycle as a major Democratic donor, committing more than $25 million to Hillary Clinton and other party candidates and causes, according to Politico.Soros has committed $5 million to a super PAC called Immigrant Voters Win that s devoted to increasing turnout among low-propensity Hispanic voters in key swing states, though FEC records show he d donated only $3 million through the end of June, the period covered by the most recent filings.Soros spent roughly $27 million in a bid to unseat then-President George W. Bush in 2004 but later scaled back his giving, the website reported. Some associates of the Soros Fund Management chairman told Politico they expect him to give even more as Election Day approaches.FOX News host, Bill O Reilly does an excellent job of exposing the truth about billionaire radical George Soros and his anti-American intentions:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KegE285GQucThe Hungarian-born financier is worth $24.9 billion, according to Forbes  most recent estimate, and his return as a big-time contributor will be a boon to the party as it seeks to retain control of the White House and regain a majority in the Senate.Soros advisor Michael Vachon told Politico that Soros  has been a consistent donor to Democratic causes, but this year the political stakes are exceptionally high.

"What is the one thing that might actually scare Donald Trump? That s right   the prospect of releasing his tax returns has him terrified. The mere thought of making them public, just as every single presidential candidate in recent memory has done, is more abhorrent to him than his sexual obsession with his daughter is to the rest of us. But unfortunately for The Donald, he may not have a choice in the matter if Senate Democrats have their way.The Connecticut Mirror reports that Senators Chris Murphy and Ron Wyden have come up with a solution to Trump s nonsensical refusal to be honest with the American people about his taxes   something even George W. Bush was able to accomplish:Partnering with fellow Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Murphy on Thursday pressed for votes for a bill that would require all presidential candidates from major parties to make public their tax returns within two weeks of their parties  national conventions. The effort is part of a renewed Democratic campaign over Trump s tax filings.In keeping his tax returns under wraps, Murphy said Trump is violating a  40-year-standard of campaign transparency and may even be running for president to change tax laws that benefit his companies. This is an extraordinary moment in which the candidate may be seeking the presidency to protect his investments,  Murphy says of his effort.What is Trump hiding?  Many people are saying  he has made substantial donations to NAMBLA   the North American Man-Boy Love Association   he does not want to become public. While this is a long-shot, as the organization is not actually tax exempt and would not show up on Trump s tax returns, it is clear that he fears their release. In any case, the  Presidential Tax Transparency Act  would let the public know all of Trump s dirty little tax secrets he desperately wants to keep hidden.In fact, it would force the FEC to post candidates  returns on the official website for all to see anytime they wish if the candidate did not voluntarily disclose them within two weeks of their party s national conventions.So far the bill only has five co-sponsors, including Tim Kaine, but the idea seems popular.Not only would this be a great idea, but it would lead to the most hilariously humiliating concession speech one can imagine.Featured image via Getty Images/Brian Bianco",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

"There s a petition on Change.org going around to stop Trump from becoming President, and it has made history, not just for its nature, but because it s the most popular ever seen. At 4.7 million signatures and counting, it s over 80 percent of the way to its goal, and the number of signatories just keeps growing.The second most popular petition on Change.org was to stop a dog meat festival, and had two million fewer signatures. That goes to show the Electoral College that a lot of people are looking for any way imaginable to stop Trump from actually getting inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2017.This petition is called  Electoral College: Make Hillary Clinton President,  and very likely won t work, if for no other reason than Republican electors just will not cast their votes for her. That s despite a popular vote lead of over two million, which is a bigger margin and several past presidents  margins of victory. They should make her president based on that, but they ve been conditioned to hate her guts. So no go there, sadly.However, we may not need the biggest petition in history to work exactly as planned, because there s a growing coalition of  faithless electors  who won t vote for Trump. Several Democratic electors have gotten together in a mad dash to convince enough other electors to vote against Trump before the Dec. 19 deadline. They re calling themselves  Hamilton Electors  after Alexander Hamilton.At least two Republican electors from Texas have also declared that they can t vote for Trump. One, Christopher Suprun, penned an op-ed in The New York Times about all the reasons he can t vote for Trump. He s also encouraging his fellow electors to reject Trump and settle on someone like John Kasich. Kasich isn t great, but compared to Trump, he d be the best president ever.Perhaps this petition has gotten the attention of some other electors, and they re planning on defecting, too. The sheer magnitude of this petition should send a clear message to them that the people want them to defect. Here s hoping they take a good, long look at what they re doing and make their decisions for the good of the country.Featured image by Mark Makela/Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

A self-confessed anti-Semite, Horthy imposed restrictive Jewish laws prior to World War II and collaborated with Hitler during the conflict.

"The picture, snapped by a White House photographer traveling with the president as he left his golf course in Sterling, Va., went viral almost immediately. News outlets picked up the story when it appeared in a White House pool report. Late-night talk show hosts told jokes about the encounter and people on social media began hailing the unidentified woman as a  she-ro,  using the hashtag #Her2020.The woman s name is Juli Briskman. Her employer, government contractor Akima LLC, wasn t so happy about the photo. They fired her over it.Juli was so proud of her disgusting and hateful act of disrespect for our President that she posted the image of herself to the top of her Facebook page:In a Saturday interview with HuffPost, Briskman, a 50-year-old mother of two, said she was stunned that someone had taken a picture of her giving Trump the middle finger.As the photo circulated online, Briskman decided to tell Akima s HR department what was happening when she went to work on Monday. By Tuesday, her bosses called her into a meeting and said she had violated the company s social media policy by using the photo as her profile picture on Twitter and Facebook. They said,  We re separating from you,  said Briskman.  Basically, you cannot have  lewd  or  obscene  things in your social media. So they were calling flipping him off  obscene. Briskman, who worked in marketing and communications at Akima for just over six months, said she emphasized to the executives that she wasn t on the job when the incident happened and that her social media pages don t mention her employer. They told her that because Akima was a government contractor, the photo could hurt their business, she said.  Huffington Post",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Joe Biden is thinking about running for POTUS in 2020 but this type of anti-gun comment is a huge deal breaker for voters If Biden had used common sense he would realize that the Texas hero stopped the gunman from proceeding with any more deaths when he used his weapon Does Biden believe that if you outlaw a certain type of gun that they won t be out there anymore?

"If you tuned into the first presidential debate last night, you already know that Hillary Clinton pretty much wiped the floor with Donald Trump. Trump was so nervous and unprepared that he was reduced to constant sniffling, excessive thirstiness and his usual outlandish rants and interruptions. Let s just say that everyone noticed.Trump couldn t take the heat, and he definitely cannot handle the humiliation that is following the debate. While several major media outlets are calling the debate a clear win for Clinton, Trump is trying to come up with reasons why he bombed so horribly (even though it was perfectly obvious that he would).The best excuse Trump has been able to come up with is beyond pathetic and nothing but a move of desperation. The Associated Press has reported that after the debate, the GOP nominee immediately told reporters that he was unable to perform to the best of his ability because there was something wrong with his microphone. And yet despite something being  wrong with it,  that mic seemed to work fine as he shouted over Hillary every few seconds. AP reported: Trump visited the media spin room after the Monday night debate and said,  They gave me a defective mic! He said he  wonder(s), was that on purpose? CBS s Sopan Deb also happened to be there and gave a little more detail into Trump s microphone conspiracy theory:TwitterTrump is seriously trying to claim that someone tried to sabotage the debate on purpose! What a moron. The truth is that Trump didn t prepare for the debate like Clinton did   and even if he had spent a little more time preparing than tweeting, it wouldn t have mattered much   he s completely unqualified for the White House. Last night, Hillary showed America that these two shouldn t even be up against each other. There is no comparison. Hillary looked like our next President, and Trump looked like a fraud and an imposter who should have never made it up on that stage.I wouldn t be surprised if Trump comes up with more lame stories about why his performance was compromised last night.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"On Saturday, President Obama officially declared that the Flint water crisis is now a federal emergency. The President s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures, authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in Genesee County,  reads a statement from FEMA.Just two days ago, Michigan s Republican governor, Rick Snyder, requested that President Obama declare the Flint water crisis a federal emergency.In April 2014, Flint s emergency manager forced the city to switch from using Detroit s water system to using the Flint River for water. The decision to do so was touted as a means to cut costs for the city. It turned out to be a disaster.There is an unusual amount of salt in the Flint River. The river is also extremely contaminated. So when the salt began to corrode the pipes of Flint s water system, lead leaked into people s drinking water. One study found the pipe corrosion problem could have been solved for as little as $100 a day. Now it is estimated that it will cost up to $1.5 billion dollars to fix Flint s water system.The statement from FEMA goes on to say that: Emergency protective measures, limited to direct federal assistance, will be provided at 75 percent federal funding. This emergency assistance is to provide water, water filters, water filter cartridges, water test kits, and other necessary related items for a period of no more than 90 days. This is great news for the city of Flint. The people of Flint are almost completely reliant on bottled water and emergency water stations. The National Guard and other governmental bodies, along with grassroots community groups, have been tasked with providing the residents of Flint those emergency water supplies. Now, they will receive funding and coordination from FEMA, which should alleviate some of the burden.Featured Image Credit:By The White House [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"While jobs in the solar energy sector account for 39 percent of all world-wide energy employment (while oil accounts for 50 percent), Fortune magazine reports that for the first time in quite a while, there are more openings for solar jobs than oil.Think about that. While the world burns for the next barrel of oil, green energy jobs are outpacing the status quo dirty energy that pulled the United States into a massive war.As Fortune finds:This [trend] corresponds with a recent report by The Solar Foundation that highlighted the rapid growth of the U.S. clean energy sector. By the end of this year, the solar sector should have 240,000 workers under its wings, and currently employs around 77% more workers than the coal mining industry.So why is this happening? Well, since the price of oil has plunged by 60 percent in the last 18 months has caused the world s largest oil and gas companies to cut jobs at an alarming rate. BP has announced it will cut 9 percent of its workforce while Chevron says it will cut 10 percent.This comes as reports show that global investment in renewable energy, most of which has come from China and India, heavy polluters, was more than twice that of coal and gas combined from last year s numbers.Tara Sinclair, chief economist of Indeed, issued a warning to those in the energy industry: see out renewable jobs, not oil.The decline in oil prices has not just rocked that industry, but jobs linked to both fossil fuels and renewable energy. Whether or not solar overtakes oil on Indeed, energy workers would do well to position themselves for work in renewable fields such as solar, wind, and hydroelectricity.With Clinton s pledge to build 600 million more solar fields and a promise to rebuild ravaged coal country with renewable energy, the amount of green workers could surge within the next several years (should she win).Is the country, and the world, moving towards a greener economy? Hopefully, it does and will send a powerful and destructive industry packing.Featured image via Wikipedia",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"While Donald Trump is considering Arizona s former Governor (and anti-immigrant) Jan Brewer as a prospective vice presidential nominee, the Clinton campaign is eyeing his now arch nemesis   Elizabeth Warren.Warren, who disappointed progressive outlets after refusing multiple times to run for president, has become a viable V.P. choice for both Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton in recent months as the primary battle heats up. In recent weeks, the mounting feud between Warren and Trump over Twitter has become an all out brawl, with the Senator from Massachusetts coming out on top every time.According to the Huffington Post, the Clinton campaign has noticed. Senior and close advisors within the frontrunner s campaign have gone on the record (albeit anonymously) saying  very influential people in the campaign pushing for her  and that her ability to  get under his [Trump s] skin  is thrilling. As one adviser told the Post: You want a running mate who can take the fight to the other side with relish. Geography does not matter, but attitude and talent and energy and bringing excitement to the campaign, Senator Warren does all that. Penny Lee, a former aide to Senator Harry Reid and now a Democratic consultant, summed up why having Warren on the ticket with Clinton would be so beneficial, and why senior advisors have been taking her seriously: She can help validate Clinton with progressives and remind them that despite their differences in the primary, the alternative of the Donald would be untenable. Outlets have speculated for months that Clinton s V.P. nominee would be Julian Castro, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or Sherrod Brown, Senator from Ohio. Castro, however, has ruled out being Clinton s V.P. While turning down the slot for second in command, Castro, who endorsed Clinton last year, has been an active surrogate for the campaign across the country.Going into a general election, Warren could prove an asset not just for the progressive vote, but for independents and moderate Republicans, who referred to Warren in a 2015 study group as  smart,   interesting,   sincere,   capable,   knowledgeable  and  sincere. Drafting Warren to a Vice Presidential spot may bode well in a presidential election, but it could hurt the Democrats  chances at keeping the senate.But with Trump as the GOP prospect, maybe a Clinton-Warren ticket could be the explosive candidacy Democrats need.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"You have got to be kidding me! After all the times that Trump has been attacked by the Democratic side of our society for saying that we need a wall on our Mexican border to stop illegals from getting into our country and destroying our economy, Obama just pulled the most hypocritical and pointless move of his career.Obama just gave a  gift  of $75 MILLION to Mexico to provide material and equipment for the building of a border wall on Mexico s SOUTHERN border and to help cover the expense of training to help man the wall properly.So basically he is helping Mexico to keep out illegals from central America because Mexico doesn t want them. Yet the Mexican President, Enrique Pe a Nieto, says he will not pay for the border wall on the northern border of Mexico to keep them out of the U.S, and Obama somehow sees the logic in this?Trump has and always will be right about the wall blocking Mexico and if Obama had wanted to help a country keep illegals out then maybe he should start in the country that he is President in. Then again Obama has given trillions of dollars away to other countries while we Americans still sit here struggling to pay simple bill like mortgages, medical, food, electricity, etc.I guess he felt the need to stick it to us in a special kind of way before we unceremoniously drop him outside of the White House gates come January 2017.H/T [ Young Cons , Conservative Tribune ]",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Donald Trump supporters have taken it upon themselves to try and throw Texas senator Ted Cruz out of the presidential race   by filing a lawsuit against him.The lawsuit, which was filed on February 3rd at a district court in Alabama, questions if Cruz is even eligible to run for president, considering that he was born in Canada. The lawsuit cites Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, which states that  no person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of president. The plaintiffs of the lawsuit are Sebastian Green, Shannon Duncan, Kathryn Spears, Kyle Spears and Jerry Parker, all residents of Cullman County as well as loyal fans of The Donald. In the suit, the plaintiffs declared that  Rafael Edward Cruz is ineligible to qualify/run/seek and be elected to the Office of the President of the United States of America. Thomas Drake, the attorney representing the group, explained: Mr. Cruz was born in Canada, and obviously Canada is not a territory or protectorate of the United States, it s not dominion of the United States. And as such, when he was born, at the moment of his birth, location determined his status, and his status was that of a natural-born Canadian citizen. You cannot be a natural-born or native-born citizen of two countries. Birther lawsuit against Ted CruzTwitterTrump has long been raising concern about Cruz s  natural born  status before, in almost the same way he did in 2011 when he went after President Barack Obama s birth certificate, claiming that that Barack wasn t a United States citizen.TwitterTed and Cruz will face each other again on Saturday, and the air between them will surely be even more tense, as the Trump has won the New Hampshire primary and Cruz took the Iowa caucuses.

Tazzy Quest (@tazzyquest) June 23, 2017Sketch artists have long been common to courtrooms, but they are a novelty for the White House, at least for the last quarter of a century. Every presidential administration for the last 25 years has allowed cameras in the press briefings, but now that the heat is on in the Russia investigation and now with an administration that lies more often than they tell the truth, news outlets have to get creative and good old analog sketch drawings it is. Hennessy isn t exclusive to CNN. There s a chance other news outlets might do the same thing.Alienating the media is perhaps one of the worst decisions in an administration full of nothing but bad decisions. The Bush administration got away with sending us into two illegal wars because they were nice to the media. Instead, the Trump administration has nothing but hostility toward the mainstream media and as a result, for the first time since cameras were allowed in press briefings, the mainstream media is doing its job. In other words, Trump can credit the media near blackout for his low approval numbers and even for the aggressive approach to the Russian investigation.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

Paying tribute to the men and women who have given their lives for our freedom is why I stand. But everyone these days likes to find a reason to protest and that s their right.

"The mosque in Finsbury Park, London where this morning s tragedy unfolded has been the centre of media attention before. It opened back in the late 80s, as the Muslim population in the area began to grow. Since then it s been one of the biggest prayer halls in Britain. However in the 90s the Mosque was accused of radicalism and its preachers linked to Al-Qaeda.Why was this Mosque allowed to go on with radical teachings after people like the shoe bomber were connected to it. It s time for the politically correct residents of towns like this to call out these Mosques. Notice that Muslims just moved to another Mosque instead of making an effort to oust the radicals within the Mosque.According to BBC,  Finsbury Park Mosque has long been synonymous with the worst fears about Islamist extremism in Britain. The mosque s new leadership have been struggling to reclaim it for the local community   but that struggle raises questions about who runs mosques in Britain. The Finsbury Park Mosque opened in 1988. And with one of the then biggest prayer halls in Britain, many Muslims regarded it as a major milestone,  BBC wrote.  But by the late 1990s, amid the growth of radical Islamism, it had become a meeting place for extreme voices, including that of Abu Hamza. The mosque was visited by  Kamel Bourgass, an Algerian man jailed for the murder of a policeman and an alleged ricin poison plot,  BBC reported.According to the Telegraph,  The Finsbury Park mosque was long known to have served as a clearing house for radical Muslims after Hamza arrived as imam in 1997. His hate-filled rants inspired attendees such as Richard Reid (SEE BELOW), the failed  shoe bomber , Zacarias Moussaoui, one of the 9/11 terror plotters, and Mohammed Sidique Khan, one of the four suicide bombers who blew themselves up on public transport in London on July 7, 2005.

"According to Pastor Darrell Reid, he was cleaning his gun inside the home he shared with his wife of 35 years on Monday, when the gun accidentally  went off,  shooting her in the head.Reid s wife, Katie, was rushed to Apopka Hospital, where she was pronounced dead a short time later.According to the Christian Post, the couple met when they were 12 years old. They ran a church called  Happy Hill Ministries  out of their home, located in Zellwood, Florida.It appears that the couple s outward appearance of happiness wasn t quite the reality.WKMG reports that police were called to the pastor s home on 23 separate occasions over the past three years.Reid was arrested multiple times for violent crimes. According to WKMG, the pastor was most recently charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, but the charge was never prosecuted. He was also charged with resisting a police officer with violence in 2012. That charge was also never prosecuted.WKMG reports:A close family friend who didn t want to be identified told News 6 the couple had a violent relationship.Reid s attorney, on the other hand, told the Orlando Sentinel that the couple  seemed very close,  noting that  they always came to court together. A neighbor said that while he couldn t imagine that Reid intentionally killed his wife, he also has a hard time understanding how you can  accidentally  shoot someone while cleaning a gun.Judging from his criminal background, Reid was someone who should never have been allowed to posses a gun. Police had been called to the couple s home almost two dozen times.  He was charged with multiple violent crimes, yet his status as a white, Christian minister no doubt helped him walk away from those crimes unpunished, time and time again.According to the website smartgunlaws.org:Florida law does not explicitly authorize or require the removal or surrender of firearms at the scene of a domestic violence incident.Police are currently investigating the  accidental  shooting death of 62-year-old Katie Reid.In the meantime, Darrell Reid remains free and likely in possession of a gun.Featured image via Happy Hill Ministries",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

When asked to elaborate on what he meant, he said: Those are the values, the values of the New York liberal politicians that have been hammering the people of this great state. And he especially went after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, saying: Every time there is a confrontation between criminals and cops he sides with the criminals, looters and rioters instead of the police officers.

"Thanks to a conservative group that tried to ruin an organized dance for LGBTQ teens, thousands of dollars were raised so those very teens could have the night of their lives.The Australian Same Sex Gender Diverse Formal is an annual gala hosted by Minus 18 for LGBTQ teenagers, giving them a place to feel safe and at home without the ridicule that might happen at most school dances. Minus 18 wrote on the event page: Imagine being told by your school that the clothes you feel comfortable wearing to a formal aren t considered  normal  or don t conform to a dress code. Imagine not being allowed to take a partner of the same sex, or being too afraid to attend altogether. It isn t unusual for LGBTQ teens to be bullied or banned when they try to bring a same-sex date or wear attire that doesn t satisfy strict gender norms. The Formal is a place where teens can be themselves and feel comfortable wearing whatever with whomever, without worrying that others will take issue with it. Knowing just how important LGBTQ events are, Minus 18 was also crowdfunding for any students who couldn t afford their $40 tickets to the dance.Unfortunately, some people just can t let others be. The Stop Safe Schools Coalition, a conservative group of bigots that go out of their way to ruin schools and groups that foster safe and inclusive environments for same-sex attracted, intersex, and gender diverse students, staff and families,  decided to try and ruin the gala.Using their 700+ Facebook fans, the right-wing group begged people to buy up as many tickets as possible so that LGBTQ teens wouldn t be able to. The group posted: The more tickets sold to us the more youth we protect. They are non-refundable unfortunately so if you are then unable to attend you can t get your money back or a ticket sold to someone else. Little did they know, that while these homophobes thought they were robbing tickets from LGBTQ teens, they were actually buying them FOR the teens! What The Stop Safe Schools Coalition had actually done was share Minus 18 s crowdfunding campaign   which allowed conservatives to unknowingly making donations to send needy LGBTQ students TO the dance. As one person hilariously pointed out on the Facebook page: You realize that if the conservatives do buy all the tickets, you can just allow registered people on a waiting list in for free? They re effectively subsidizing tickets for those who can t buy one. This is one time where the stupidity of conservatives actually paid off. Thanks to their ignorance, Minus 18 DOUBLED their crowdfunding goal of $15,000 for 500 tickets.

The one who is most notorious for being a useless sack of protoplasm is Justice Clarence Thomas. The guy never says a word. He just sits there, staring into space and waiting until he can render his verdict. It s a contemptible type of conduct for someone who is supposed to help decide on issues that are of grave importance to millions of   if not all   Americans on a daily basis.Thomas has openly admitted in the past that he has a work ethic that can be summed up best by the word  zero.  There were times he had admitted that he decided how he would rule on a case before it even started. This is literally judicial malpractice. As a judge, the essence of how you do your job is tied to listening to evidence and making a conclusion based on the facts in an impartial way. What Clarence Thomas does is a complete abdication of his responsibilities as a Supreme Court justice.So  you must be wondering,  What does Clarence Thomas do all day at work if he doesn t actually DO or even SAY anything? You ll get your answer by hitting the play button below:look at this drawing from SCOTUS oral arguments yesterday pic.twitter.com/eSTR9IiEfN  sarah jeong (@sarahjeong) April 22, 2016A courtroom artist decided to be brutally honest and draw Clarence Thomas doing exactly what he does   sleeping on the job.Yes, a judge on the highest court in the free world, responsible for deciding cases of monumental importance to the function of our republic, finds it to be just fine to just sit and sleep during his work day. After all, it s not like he will have anything to say! Why not just sit there and sleep while getting paid. Right?This is the trash you get when you have Republican presidents. This is why it s important to vote.Featured image via Wikicommons",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"The left wants to change  hurtful  words to whatever they deem to be ok but they got some push back with the order to keep the word  illegal alien  in the Library of Congress In a victory against political correctness, the House voted to order the Library of Congress to continue referring to  illegal aliens  rather than change the designation to  noncitizen. The party line vote had Democrats fuming, claiming the term was  pejorative  and that liberal doublespeak can never be repealed once it s in use.Well that s not exactly what one Democrat said. Texas Democrat Rep. Joaquin Castro told the House,  The words  illegal alien  will be retired. This will change, whether it s now or six months from now or 10 years from now. For the first time in history, conservatives hijacked a legislative appropriations bill to stop the Library of Congress from abandoning the term  illegal alien  from how it catalogs the 162 million-item collection it manages. Texas Congressman Joaquin Castro attempted to make an amendment to the legislation allowing the Library of Congress to make the change, but it failed to gain traction in the Republican-dominated House. Each year, the Library of Congress makes thousands of changes to its subject headings; in 2015 alone, it added 4,934 new subject headings. Never before has Congress weighed in on the Library of Congress  subject headings in any way, let alone legislated on the issue,  Castro said in a statement.Via: PJ Media",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"So that immigration crisis you never hear about on your evening news? It s not over. Not by a long shot.With only a few months left to go before a new president obtains the keys to the Oval Office, the Obama administration released another 6,051 unaccompanied alien children into American communities in the month of October, averaging about 195 kids per day.According to recent stats released by the Executive Office for Immigration Review, only about 45 percent of all immigration cases opened for unaccompanied minors since July of 2014 have been closed. EOIR data also shows that nearly 40 percent of all illegal alien children ordered to appear before an immigration judge won t show up for their final court hearing.Children who come across the border unlawfully and without a parent or guardian are being released at an alarming rate that corresponds with the increasing number of kids currently being apprehended along the U.S.-Mexico border. In October alone, Customs and Border Protection reported they apprehended 46,197 illegal aliens crossing into the United States unlawfully via the Southwest U.S. border, including 13,124 members of family units and another 6,754 unaccompanied children. For entire story: MRCTVWhat has escaped all but a few conversations are the short and long term implications of this flood of children haphazardly being placed in detention or residential settings, or released to family members, and how it can precipitate a fertile recruiting opportunity for gangs such as MS-13 and the 18th Street Gang, who already have assimilation within this diaspora, putting not only domestic but regional security in question.Since 2009, the numbers of unaccompanied alien children up to 17 years old, as they are designated by Customs and Border Protection under the aegis of the Department of Homeland Security, has grown exponentially, with children from Honduras representing the largest diaspora, followed by Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico.

"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Tuesday that a Somali refugee charged with ramming his car into a Canadian policeman, stabbing him and then injuring four people while leading officers on a high-speed chase over the weekend was ordered deported from the U.S. in 2011.Jennifer Elzea, an ICE spokeswoman, said Hasan Sharif Abdulahi was taken into ICE s custody in San Diego in July of that year and in September an immigration judge ordered him sent back to Somalia.Elzea said Sharif was released from custody two months later then failed to report as ordered for his removal on Jan. 24, 2012. She said efforts to locate him were unsuccessful.Sharif faces 11 charges, including five of attempted murder in the Saturday night attack in Edmonton, Alberta. Police have raised the possibility of filing terrorism charges against Sharif because there was an Islamic State flag in his car and he was investigated in 2015 for espousing extremist views.Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said Sharif, 30, entered Canada legally in 2012 and obtained refugee status.A preliminary hearing for Sharif opened Tuesday but was recessed so he can find a lawyer. He appeared on closed-circuit television and followed proceedings with the help of an interpreter. The suspect spoke briefly with a lawyer who stepped forward to help.Edmonton police say they believe Sharif acted alone during the series of attacks, which began around 8:15 p.m. Saturday as police Constable Mike Chernyk was handling crowd control outside a Canadian Football League game at a stadium just northeast of downtown.

"On Wednesday a 20-year-old special needs man was gunned down by an angry gun owner in Landover Hills, Maryland.According to WJLA, the shooting occurred as the victim, identified as Conrad Cole, was walking to a nearby park to play basketball with his two caretakers. Witnesses say that the 20-year-old group home resident lost control of his basketball. The ball brushed against a nearby car.The owner of the vehicle, who has since been identified as 28-year-old Roderick Town, aggressively confronted Cole.During an interview with WJLA, Prince George County Police Chief Hank Stawinski described what happened next: The special needs individual is not communicating clearly. The individual in the car retrieves a weapon and shoots the person a number of times. Stawinski called the shooting  a senseless murder. After killing the special needs man, Town fled the scene.He was arrested on Saturday. Town faces charges of first-degree and second-degree murder, as well as additional charges.Here s more on the story from WJLA.According to the Washington Post, Maryland has  some of the strictest gun laws in the nation. The state s supposedly strict gun laws do nothing to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, convicted felons or people on the FBI s terrorist watch list. Democrats have been trying to change that.Police have yet to release information on what type of gun was used in this senseless killing, nor have they disclosed whether Town was legally permitted to own a gun in MD.What we do know is that contrary to NRA myths, the presence of a gun does not reduce the odds of violent crime.Time and time again we see minor arguments escalate to this level of violence. As decades of research shows, the mere presence of a gun during a heated conflict contributes to higher levels of aggression and violence.Guns and anger are a deadly combination. Sadly, research also shows that the more angry and impulsive a person is, the more likely they are to own and carry a gun.As reported here: A June 2015 study found that  310 million firearms estimated to be in private hands in the United States are disproportionately owned by people who are prone to angry, impulsive behavior and have a potentially dangerous habit of keeping their guns close at hand. While no one has all the answers when it comes to preventing gun violence, we do know that putting even more guns into the hands of angry people is not the solution.Image credit: video screen capture via WJLA",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"The fundamental transformation of America continues . But one photo emerges that defies Barack and Michelle Obama s hateful and divisive narrative.In the latest chapter of the outcry over the Confederate flag issue in South Carolina, an unexpected scene emerged from rallies involving the Ku Klux Klan and black supporters this weekend   a photo of a black police officer helping a white supremacist at the Capitol in Charleston.Members of the Loyal White Knights of the KKK were protesting the state s recent decision to remove the flag from the statehouse grounds. Black advocates held their own rally, and a clash among the two parties ensued.IN THE MIDST OF SO MUCH HATE, ONE HOPEFUL PHOTO EMERGED: It didn t take long for the photograph   taken by Rob Godfrey, the deputy chief of staff for South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley   to spread on the Internet. Not an uncommon example of humanity in SC: Leroy Smith helps white supremacist to shelter & water as heat bears down,  Godfrey wrote in posting the photo on Twitter.Officer Leroy Smith was helping the man find shade and water on a hot day in Charleston, when temperatures reached the upper 90s. About 2,000 people attended the rallies. He was assisting with crowd control on the stairs where the KKK was rallying,  spokeswoman Sherri Iacobelli said of Smith.As might be expected, the general public largely fell into one of two camps   applauding the photo, or questioning it. This kindness chokes me up. How do SC people find that well of caring in the midst of so much hatred?  one person replied in the photo s comment thread. Amazing! I couldn t find it in my heart and I am white,  another remarked. Just curious. Put this in reverse. Would that White Supremacist have done that for Officer Smith at a Black Panther rally?  countered one tweet. Being nice didn t save those 9 people [at the Charleston church shooting] though,  posted another.Thursday, Haley encouraged people to stay away from the KKK rally. The strength and grace the people of South Carolina have shown over the last three weeks have inspired our family, our neighbors and the entire world,  she wrote on her Facebook page.  Our family hopes the people of South Carolina will join us in staying away from the disruptive, hateful spectacle members of the Ku Klux Klan hope to create.

"Monday night s debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton was so one-sided that virtually everyone, short of the most ardent Trump supporters, thinks the GOP candidate tanked, bigly.Social media isn t pretty for Trump. Even his white supremacist base is doubting him after his subpar performance in Monday s debate. Here are just some from Stormfront. If you aren t familiar with Stormfront, they are proud  white nationalists  and they are very pro-Trump. They re still pro-Trump, but they know that their candidate dug himself a hole on Monday night. Here are a few of their posts, courtesy of the Concourse:Stormfront isn t the only group that believes Hillary  mopped the floor  with Trump. 4chan, the alt-right message board, was filled with disheartened white supremacists (our favorite kind). They were filled with excuses, but the overwhelming opinion seemed to be that their candidate was beaten by a woman.Some were offended when Trump said the DNC hack could have been orchestrated by someone weighing 400 pounds and sitting on his bed.White nationalists aren t the only conservative voters complaining that their candidate lost. I m not positive Hillary actually won the debate. But I m sure Trump lost it. He choked,  writes Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol.Ouch, when Bill Kristol turns on you Even if you are a Trump supporter, you have to think that he left a lot on the table,  writes GOP supper lobbyist Ed Rogers, a veteran of the Reagan and Bush 41 White Houses.  He didn t see the openings and he didn t swing at the softballs that came his way. He never used the word  change,  he didn t bore in on Hillary s email scandal and he never got around to the Clinton Foundation and Hillary s suspect integrity. Trump was inarticulate and rarely hit the bull s eye. Not exactly giving props to Hillary, but After the first 20 minutes, it may have been the most lopsided debate I ve ever seen   and not because Clinton was particularly effective. But you don t need to be good when your opponent is bad,  writes National Review s David French, who considered running for president as an independent.  Why didn t he have a better answer ready for the birther nonsense? Has he still not done any homework on foreign policy? I felt like I was watching the political Titanic hit the iceberg, back up, and hit it again. Just for fun. The Washington Post has a bunch of other conservative reactions.While it s doubtful the white supremacists or any of the other quoted conservatives will pull the lever for Hillary Clinton, it is clear that Trump showed his vulnerabilities last night and he proved that he s not fit, at all, to be Commander-in-Chief.Featured image via Michael Bocchieri/Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"But wait If WMD s have been banned by the international community, how is it possible for ISIS to use them against the West? Is the Left finally waking up to realize bad guys don t follow the rules? ISIS already has smuggled chemical and biological weapons into the EU The terror organisation has also recruited chemists and physicists Western governments warned to alert the public about potential attackISIS has recruited experts with chemistry, physics and computer science degrees to wage war with weapons of mass destruction against the West, a shocking European Parliament report has claimed.The terror organisation, according to the briefing document,  may be planning to try to use internationally banned weapons of mass destruction in future attacks .The document, which was compiled in the aftermath of the deadly attacks on Paris claimed that ISIS has already smuggled WMD material into Europe.Experts fear that ISIS will be able to exploit a failure of EU governments to share information on possible terrorists. Already, British police forces have been conducting exercises on how to deal with various types of terrorist attack. But the EU report claims that government should  consider publicly addressing the possibility of terrorist attack using chemical, biological, radiological or even nuclear materials .The report, ISIL/Da esh and  non-conventional  weapons of terror warns:  At present, European citizens are not seriously contemplating the possibility that extremist groups might use chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) materials during attacks in Europe. Under these circumstances, the impact of such an attack, should it occur, would be even more destabilising. Rob Wainwright, head of Europol said after the attacks on Paris:  We are dealing with a very serious, well-resourced, determined international terrorist organisation that is now active on the streets of Europe. This represents the most serious terrorist threat faced in Europe for 10 years. Mr Wainwright warned that ISIS had serious capabilities in terms of resources and manpower. Intelligence services have also been warned to screen returning Jihadi fighters for  specialist CBRN knowledge .  Interpol s monthly CBRN intelligence reports show numerous examples of attempts to acquire, smuggle or use CBRN materials.   Via: UK Daily Mail ",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Smug liberal newspapers and tv networks have paid a heavy price  for their criticism of Trump. Americans think of Trump as the underdog in this race and there s nothing worse than piling on the underdog. For these liberal hacks who have been writing their leftist opinions as opposed to real news for decades, they re about to find out what it means to be considered irrelevant by their former readers The subscription cancellations were coming every 10 minutes. Angry readers have been calling in droves. We re feeling the weight of our history,  Phil Boas, the editorial page editor of The Arizona Republic, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. Until it endorsed Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, the newspaper, founded in 1890, had never endorsed a Democrat over a Republican for president.In endorsing Mrs. Clinton, The Republic s editorial was, by any interpretation, scathing toward her opponent, Donald J. Trump.  Trump responds to criticism with the petulance of verbal spit wads,  the editorial says at one point.  That s beneath our national dignity. The papers lay out different reasons for supporting Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump   his lack of political experience versus her established political career, his outbursts and insults versus her steadiness   and some are perhaps more repudiations of Mr. Trump than glowing endorsements of Mrs. Clinton, whose faults are also cited.For some readers, however, the endorsements proved a step too far.  Certainly, we ve paid a price for our presidential recommendation,  Mike Wilson, the editor of The Dallas Morning News, told Poynter this month.Mr. Boas of The Arizona Republic said he expected  a lot of cancellations,  pointing to cancellations at The Cincinnati Enquirer, which like The Republic, is owned by Gannett.But he said financial considerations were  never a factor  for the newspaper s nine-person editorial board.  It was more of a curiosity,  he said.  We know we re doing the right thing. We feel very good about this decision.

"It s pretty rare that a presidential candidate would regret getting an endorsement while on the campaign trail, but such might be the case for GOPer Marco Rubio after what former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum did to him!Having recently dropped out of his own race for the White House, Santorum decided to throw his support behind the Flordia senator yesterday, giving the candidate his best wishes and a passionate endorsement. This endorsement followed Rubio s third-place win in Iowa on Monday, and the candidate is picking up speed for the New Hampshire primary taking place next week.But on Thursday morning, Santorum s endorsement had the complete opposite effect on Rubio s campaign. Instead of being a great boost, it just made both politicians look incapable and stupid, thanks to Santorum s appearance on Morning Joe. Host Joe Scarborough simply asked the question  What do you list as Marco Rubio s top accomplishment?  and it all went downhill from there! You can watch the awkward, embarrassing footage below:Santorum not only squirmed and danced around what was an understandable question, but failed to finally give any sort of satisfying answer. Some of Santorum s meek side-stepping remarks were that Rubio [Won] a tough election in Florida, pull[ing] people together from a variety of spots  and that  He s someone who brings people together! Meanwhile, the Morning Joe panel couldn t help but laugh at how absurd the situation was. In a final attempt, Scarborough firmly pressed the former senator, He s been in the Senate four years. Can you name his top accomplishment? And Santorum proved that even with the help of the show s hosts, he just couldn t come up with even one thing Rubio had done. Defeated and tired of smiling and shaking his head, Santorum eventually said,  The bottom line is there isn t a whole lot of accomplishments, Joe,  and accused the host of asking him something  I just don t think it s a fair question  (even though it was completely straightforward and logical).This interview was so awkward that at one point, Scarborough s co-host Mika Brzezinski said, Hold on.

"Another item Obama can check off his bucket list More than a quarter million Muslims have become registered voters since the last presidential election, a Muslim group reported on Tuesday.In June there were 824,000 registered Muslim voters whose first, middle or last names matched a list of 43,538 traditionally Muslim names, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which used a private national database of voter information. That number represents a significant bump from the 500,000 voters the group accounted for in 2012, using the same method.One reason for the surge, CAIR suggests, is  increased political involvement resulting from rhetorical attacks on that faith community by public figures.  While the press release does not mention GOP presumptive nominee Donald Trump by name, it does contain two links to articles about how the candidate is  attacking Muslims  and  fueling prejudice, hate incidents. CAIR government affairs director Robert McCaw applauded the Muslim community for its efforts to get out the vote, and slammed  hostile  proposals made by Trump over the course of his campaign, including a ban on Muslims entering the United States. As a community under the pressure of hostile political rhetoric calling for profiling of American Muslims, Muslim immigration bans and warrantless surveillance of mosques, we must utilize all the tools of positive civic engagement to preserve religious freedom and other constitutional rights,  said McCaw.Earlier in the month, CAIR launched a nonpartisan voter campaign, titled  Muslims Vote,  to encourage increased participation by American Muslims in the 2016 election cycle. The campaign looks for ways to get American Muslims involved in a number of activities, including volunteering, voter registration and hosting candidate forums.

Sekulow goes on to say that Trump was actually responding to news reports of an investigation.Funny, because that s not what it sounded like from Trump himself. Surely the President of the United States knows how to be clear in his official White House tweets. The tweet from the president was in response to the five anonymous sources purportedly leaking info to the Washington Post,  Sekulow said, referring to the Washington Post s report that Special Counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into Russian interference in the election, now also includes a look at whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice. He s not afraid of the investigation   there is no investigation,  Sekulow said, adding,  there is not an investigation of the President of the United States, period.

DWTo integration commissioner  zoguz the problem lies in the fact that decision-makers in associations like DITIB have never really settled in Germany,  although for the most part, the members have.In other words, the leaders of the most powerful Muslim group in Germany have no interest in assimilating with Germans, but do have an interest in accepting public funds from German taxpayers to keep their organization up and running.However, DITIB does not seem capable of surviving only off Ankara s support and without help from Germany. After payments to the association were temporarily suspended because of the espionage affair, the money has been flowing into its accounts again. According to the German Ministry of Family Affairs,  It was decided that funding for projects that have already been approved would resume under consideration of all relevant aspects.

"Republican presidential candidate Gov. Chris Christie is mad. He is so mad, in fact, at Michelle Obama for wanting kids to eat healthy, that he has just openly come out against her initiative for healthier children. Sound crazy? Because it is.Never mind the fact that it was only a few short years ago when Christie lauded the First Lady on her healthy eating agenda when he said: I think it s a really good goal to encourage kids to eat better. You know, I ve  I ve struggled with my weight for thirty years and it s a struggle. And if a kid can avoid that in his adult years or her adult years, more power to them. And I think the first lady is speaking out well. I mean, I don t want the government deciding what you can and what you can t eat. I still think that s your choice. But I think Mrs. Obama being out there encouraging people in a positive way to eat well and to exercise and to be healthy, I don t have a problem with that. Now he s trying to run for president and knows that the people he needs nationally to vote for him don t want some commie agenda of healthy eating. After all, Eve ate the forbidden apple, but there is NOTHING in the Bible against eating Twinkies for dinner.While campaigning in Iowa on Monday, Christie told a young child in the crowd that he ll be able to eat whatever he wants if Christie were to be elected. He told the kid: The First Lady has no business being involved in this. Using the government to mandate her point of view on what people should be eating every day is none of her business, it just isn t. I want people to eat healthier. I ve been trying to eat more healthy. We all should be trying to do that. It makes us better, makes us living longer, better quality of life, all the rest of it. But in the end, it s your choice. I don t care what you re eating for lunch every day. I really don t. I want you to eat whatever your mother wants you to eat and your father want you to eat. And if your parents want you to eat gum drops and Mountain Dew as a balanced meal, go for it. Who cares if kids get sick from malnutrition or get diabetes and raise health costs nationwide?

Just like former First Lady Laura Bush promoted reading, and Nancy Reagan was a against drug use, it s not a communist plot to take over the minds of our youth. It s to suggest and promote positive actions in the lives of children. That s all. Calm down. And Christie, really?

"Donald Trump s reaction to the London terrorist attack could not have been more disgraceful. Not only did he use the incident to promote his extremely unconstitutional Muslim ban, but he trashed the London mayor and completely failed to send a message of solidarity or hope.Thank goodness we still have Hillary Clinton, the overqualified Democratic presidential candidate who won the popular vote by millions. Despite losing the election to an undeserving orange man baby, Clinton has not abandoned Americans or the world, and continues to act far more presidential than the current moron we have in the White House.Clinton also responded to the London attack, and it was a sharp reminder that we elected the wrong candidate. In her response on Twitter, Clinton showed everyone just how an American president should act, and just how much Trump falls short. She tweeted: After acts of unspeakable cruelty and cowardice, the people of London and the UK choose resolve over fear. Your friends in the US stand with you. Trump s message was divisive, while Clinton sent out a call for unity and peace. At a time when Trump currently has a historically low 36% approval rating, it appears that America is admitting that the wrong person is in the White House.This amazing message from Clinton is hardly surprising. During Trump s abrasive presidential campaign, in which he attacked her nonstop for months, Clinton always remained classy, dignified, and focused on the job ahead. She was always there for the American people, and truly believed in the values this country was built on.This tweet should be burned into the minds of every American when it comes time to vote in 2018 and 2020. America cannot afford to keep Trump in office, or to have another imbecile like him leading the country.Featured image is a screenshot ",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz has been fantasizing about investigating a potential President Hillary Clinton into oblivion based on her use of a private email server. After all, Chaffetz has promised, quote,  years  of Clinton investigations should she be elected. This all comes after an unprecedented   not to mention completely inappropriate   letter that FBI Director James Comey sent to House Republicans saying that he was re-investigating new emails. Well, now, Comey has, once again, cleared Hillary of what was to become yet another anti-Clinton GOP witch hunt, and House Republicans are sure to be furious. Here is the tweet of the letter:New Comey letter: FBI has not changed its conclusion regarding Clinton use of personal email server pic.twitter.com/IdKT1gweMf  Jim Acosta (@Acosta) November 6, 2016Nonetheless, Chaffetz himself had to admit that Hillary is in the clear with this one. He tweeted:FBI Dir just informed us ""Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Sec Clinton""  Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) November 6, 2016Of course, most sane people know that the idea that Hillary is some kind of criminal is nothing more than decades of right-wing witch hunting, and her campaign is right to say that they have always been confident that she did nothing wrong. Therefore, top adviser Brian Fallon tweeted the following regarding this news:We were always confident nothing would cause the July decision to be revisited. Now Director Comey has confirmed ithttps://t.co/BMQQx9eRzw  Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) November 6, 2016The thing is this, though: Comey and his rogue FBI agents directly impacted the election with baseless and wild accusations. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is supposed to be non-partisan, and has been anything but. Hell, there were inside agents who even called the New York FBI, quote,  Trumpland. The bottom line is this: The whole situation never should have happened. Rogue agents never should have been leaking information regarding an ongoing investigation, and Comey himself should have never gone to Congress with that letter eleven days shy of this all-important and highly contentious election.When Hillary gets elected, she should clean house, and restore confidence in one of America s most important institutions.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Dominican newspaper El Nacional had a bit of fun with our comically inept President* when they  accidentally  used a photo of Trump s arch-nemesis Alec Baldwin instead of our orange-skinned wannabe dictator in a recent story.The story was regarding Trump s upcoming meeting with war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu following the United States  decision to block a Palestinian official from a U.N. appointment for fear it would hurt Bibi s precious little feelings. The United States was disappointed to see a letter indicating the intention to appoint the former Palestinian Authority prime minister to lead the UN Mission in Libya,  unqualified mess of a human being and U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley said. For too long the U.N. has been unfairly biased in favor of the Palestinian Authority to the detriment of our allies in Israel. This, of course, is sure to make Netanyahu happy prior to the meeting, where he and Trump are expected to discuss moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.The paper posted what appears to be a  tongue-in-cheek  photo correction, claiming that they were sent the photo by the Associated Press.It is unclear if this was an honest mistake or an  alt-mistake,  but one thing is for certain   Trump is not going to be happy when he sees this.Featured image via screengrab",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"It was only a matter of time before Donald Trump responded to conservative columnist George Will leaving the GOP, and the Republican nominee did so childishly as usual.While Trump was in Scotland fawning over his new golf course, Will attended a Federalist Society event on Friday and made the shocking announcement that he has left the Republican Party and changed his party affiliation to  unaffiliated. This is not my party,  Will said before urging Republicans to  make sure  Trump  loses.  Republicans will just have to  grit their teeth  through four years of Hillary Clinton and try again in 2020 when they wise up enough to nominate someone who isn t as offensive as Trump.Will explained on Sunday that his exodus from the party is the result of Trump viciously attacking Judge Gonzalo Curiel for being of Mexican heritage. For weeks, Trumps has launched racist attacks at the judge, who is overseeing the case against Trump University, and saying that Curiel can t be fair to him because of what he has said about Mexicans and his support of a wall. After Trump went after the  Mexican  judge from northern Indiana then Paul Ryan endorsed him, I decided that in fact this was not my party anymore,  Will told Fox News Sunday.That was the last straw for Will and he decided to leave the Republican train wreck after decades of supporting the party through thick and thin.After returning back to the United States from Scotland, however, Donald Trump couldn t hold his tongue and threw a hissy fit on Twitter about Will dumping the party because of him. George Will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago), has left the Republican Party,  Trump wrote.  He s made many bad calls.

"Social conservatives run campaigns and win elections on platforms of so-called  family values.  Often, though, it turns out that these supposedly pure people are anything but. Case in point   Cheektowaga, New York lawmaker Angela Wozniak.This particular gem has now been forbidden to have interns after conducting an extramarital affair with one. After the young man, Elias Farah, shut the affair down, Wozniak began sexually harassing him. She also make his job a living hell, and kept him from attending and participating in events. After all of this came to light, a panel committee consisting of both Republicans and Democrats was formed to address this grossly and obviously improper conduct. Ultimately, it was decided that Wozniak was guilty of incredibly poor judgment  in conducting this affair and her behavior after it was over. There was, however, no way to prove on a legal level that Wozniak created a  hostile work environment  or sexually harassed Farah.Despite the lack of legal evidence, though, the investigating committee is now going to look into Wozniak s office every six months going forward. Also, her attempts to go after her accuser have luckily backfired, as she ironically ran for office after a Democratic opponent, Dennis Gabryszak, resigned over his own sexual scandal. A potential November Democratic opponent, sums up Wozniak s hypocritical behavior perfectly: She ran on a platform of family values based on the conduct of her predecessor. I hope to restore voters  confidence in their government and be a leader they can be proud of. And that is the problem with these holier than thou  family values  types. They make literal careers of condemning other people s lives and modes of living, all the while doing in private just what they preach against in public.No one would care if these people didn t try to pretend to be above the rest of us. But, since they do   good riddance to yet another  family values  hypocrite. I m sure it s only a matter of time before Angela Wozniak is forced to resign.Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"The rules must not apply to Caroline Biden, niece of Joe Biden The wild-child niece of former Veep Joe Biden stole more than $100,000 in a credit card scam   and quietly cut a plea deal in Manhattan court that spares her any jail time, The Post has learned.Using a borrowed credit card, the blonde Caroline Biden set up an unauthorized customer account at Bigelow Pharmacy on Sixth Avenue in Greenwich Village, and racked up the six-figure bill over the course of a year, according to a criminal complaint that does not name the victim card owner.As part of a plea deal before Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Kevin McGrath, Biden, 29, pleaded guilty to one charge of grand larceny and another of petit larceny and agreed to make restitution of $110,810.04.If she pays everything back and keeps her nose clean, she can return to court and enter a substitute plea to a lower, misdemeanor charge of petit larceny and be sentenced to two years probation.But she ll stay out of jail even if she fails to live up to the plea deal, instead getting sentenced on the felony larceny to five years probation.Defense lawyer Ira London declined to comment.Biden was also in Manhattan Criminal Court in 2014, on charges of resisting arrest, obstruction of justice and harassment stemming from a dustup with her Tribeca roommate.In that case, the silver-spoon Georgetown University graduate was accused of taking a swing at a female cop who responded in Sept. 2013 to a drag out fight over unpaid rent between Biden and her roommate.

Senator Lindsey Graham appeared to be concerned about Trump s decision to meet with the Russian lawyer who ended up only wanting to talk about adoptions.

We cannot allow foreign governments to reach out to anybody s campaign and say  we d like to help you.  That is a non-starter. I know that Donald Trump Jr. is new to politics, I know that Jared Kushner is new to politics, but, um this is gonna require a lot of uh questions to be asked and answered. MSNBC was delighted to hear Lindsey Graham questioning Trump Jr. s judgement in agreeing to take the meeting. Graham continued to express his feelings about the meeting, suggesting that Trump Jr. should have to testify about what transpired in the alleged meeting.  Graham was then asked by the MSNBC reporter,  Do you think the White House has been truthful about the version of events that happened and their meetings that occurred between their associates and the Russians?  Graham responded, It s been very frustrating to find out every couple of weeks about a new meeting. I m sure they met with a lot of people during the campaign.

"Even though alleged president Donald Trump s executive order banning seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. has caused widespread panic, he told Fox News host Bill O Reilly on Sunday that the move was going  smoothly.  Trump s fake news  facts failed to mention that his poorly worded order sent the world into chaos.When O Reilly asked the man-baby POTUS how the travel ban worked out following the executive order, Trump said,  I think it was very smooth. You had 109 people out of hundreds of thousands of travelers and all we did was vet those people very, very carefully. Actually, that s not true and we re sure you re shocked. 60,000 visas were revoked following his Muslim ban.Press Secretary Sean Spicer also echoed Trump s claims previously that only 109 people were affected by his travel ban on the seven Muslim countries even though that claim was disproved.Facts matter:While DHS estimates suggest that around 375 travelers who were in transit were stranded or detained, thousands of refugees were put into limbo when Trump scuttled the U.S. refugee program.During the jaw-dropping interview in which even a Fox News host challenged him, Trump insisted multiple times that the executive order was implemented in a  smooth  fashion and only 109 people were affected.In that same interview, Trump was asked by the Fox News host why he respects Vladimir Putin. O Reilly said,  He s a killer  and the host was not lying. Still yet, Trump said,  There are a lot of killers. You think our country s so innocent? Watch:President Trump Bannon also said he s against sanctuary cities.From there, Trump went into the same dangerous territory his team keeps venturing into. He wants to prove he won the popular vote, but he s doing so without proof. O Reilly told him he needs data to back him up his claim that 3 million people voted for in the 2016 U.S. presidential election illegally, Trump insisted that Mike Pence will set up a commission to investigate the widespread voter fraud which has already been debunked.Image via screen capture.

"Now that Republicans are only a month away from officially nominating a racist, sexist, bigot, companies responsible for funding the Republican National Convention are pulling out, and for good reason: bigotry isn t good for business.Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, Motorola, Ford, Walgreens and UPS (all of whom sponsored the 2012 convention) have announced they will be pulling out of this year s convention. Although none of the companies have publicly said why they are pulling out, Trump s continuous slamming of the Ford Corporation could explain why the motor company is calling it quits. Sources close with Wells Fargo say they will continue to sponsor the Democratic National Convention because of a large market outreach in Philadelphia.Coca-Cola has also pulled out of the RNC, citing bad publicity.Reports are surfacing that delegates for the RNC are gearing up to stage a coup against trump, thus brokering the convention and thwarting the billionaire s chances of taking on Hillary Clinton (who would mop the floor with him).Their decision to pull out comes as the RNC is close to reaching their goal of $64 million to fund the convention. With these companies now retracting their monetary support, the RNC will have to find new ways to make up for the lost funds. Maybe they could ask their nominee? He is a  billionaire,  after all.Several months ago, the New York Times reported Apple, Walmart, and Google are considering pulling out as well, as public pressure mounts against the presumptive nominee.Republican fundraising consultant Carla Eudy told the Times:I have talked to several people at companies who have said,  I ve always gone to the convention, I ve always participated at some level, but this year we re not putting it in our budget, we re not going, we re no going to sponsor any of the events going on.Things aren t looking good for the RNC, and yet Reince Priebus insists everything is O.K. when, in fact, nothing is O.K.

"A recent poll from Quinnipiac University has stunned the political world when it showed Hillary Clinton losing serious ground against Donald Trump in key swing states like Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania.However, what the media isn t reporting on is an even newer poll that shows Clinton s strong numbers against Trump in swing states (including Florida).A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Secretary Clinton crushing Donald Trump in Florida, Colorado, North Carolina and Virginia.In Colorado, she beats Trump by eight points, 43-35. In Florida (which the Quinnipiac Poll had Trump beating her by 3 points), Clinton is beating the Republican nominee by seven points, 44-37. Then there s north Carolina, where the former secretary is beating Trump by six points. It should be important to remember that President Obama lost North Carolina in 2012 after winning it in 2008.Finally in Virginia, in which the state s senator, Tim Kaine, is rumored to be a V.P. pick   Clinton beats Trump by nine points, 44-35, her biggest lead in a swing state.All these states make up 66 electorate votes, a sizeable chunk in the electoral tally.Not only does Clinton lead Trump in these states, she is also more well liked than their billionaire blowhard. The only thing Trump leads in is in unfavorability.While the media continues to harp on and on about Clinton being an unfavorable and disliked candidate, they somehow ignore the fact that Trump is losing in key battleground states because he is even more disliked.For someone who describes themselves as  the king of polls,  Trump has certainly been quiet about his losing edge against Clinton in the states that matter the most. The Clinton campaign has not brushed off the Trump campaign. They expect a close race. Remember, there s only one candidate who said they ll be so great they ll win California: hint, it wasn t Clinton.Democrats need to quit freaking out. No one is underestimating Trump.

No, we re not talking about people going into the ladies  room to pee.

Christians have been marching through Target stores across the nation whole screaming about how evil it is to allow human beings to go to the bathroom without feeling out of place.In one video, a Bible-waving mother marches through a Target store with her husband and children in tow to let people know what she views as the truth about Target s evil bathroom policy: Attention Target customers: Do not be deceived. Target would have you believe that they love mothers and children. This is a deception. This is not love, and they ve proven it by opening their bathrooms to perverted men. I am a mother of 12,  she announces with her Bible raised in the air,  and I am very disgusted by this wicked practice. Target does not protect mothers and children.

"21st Century Wire says This is the news that the elite political establishment did not want to hear.Watch a video of this report here:A new poll by Rasmussen Reports has Donald Trump beating Hillary Clinton by two points in a head-to-head matchup.Trump comes in at 41% with Clinton trailing behind with 39%.15% of respondents would prefer some other candidate, while 5% were undecided.Last week, Rasmussen ran the same poll and the candidates were evenly split with 38% each.Other polls have suggested that Trump has no chance of beating Hillary, but this latest development certainly brings those conclusions into question.The elite political establishment class is definitely going to be worried by this news, and the ridiculous attacks levelled against Trump may be about to reach new heights.Most worrying for those elites is the thought of America getting along with other countries, something that Trump has explicitly stated he wants to do as president.This means an end to foreign adventurism that has made the military industrial complex such a force to be reckoned with in modern America.Trump has even said that he wants to promote stability around the world and not change, implicitly suggesting that supporting foreign terrorist groups to overthrow nations is the wrong move.This new poll means that this drastic change to American foreign policy direction is one step closer to becoming reality, and with Trump himself promising to crush  Crooked Hillary Clinton  in the debates   this could be just the start of things to come.GET THE FULL STORY ON THE ELECTION: 21st Century Wire 2016 Election Files",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

"To hear Donald Trump tell it, he s the best, hugest, biggest boss there has ever been and the way he runs his businesses (if you ignore the multiple bankruptcies and closures) means the people who work for him should be overwhelmingly proud to be under his leadership.But Reuters has done some number-crunching on what kind of financial support the people who work in his businesses have shown to his presidential campaign, and as he would say, it s very  sad! Only a dozen of an estimated 22,450 people employed at Trump s companies have donated more than $200 to the celebrity businessman s bid for the U.S. presidency, a Reuters review of federal campaign finance records through August shows. Those who gave less to either Trump s campaign or his joint fundraising committees would not have shown up in the review.The contributors, including an office cleaner, a golf course groundskeeper, a bartender and an attorney, have given $5,298 to Trump s campaign, a fraction of the $112 million Trump s political operation has received from donors and joint fundraisers.The news service also points out that an employee at the Trump companies even has donated to Secretary Hillary Clinton, his electoral rival and the current front-runner in the presidential contest.By comparison, in 2012 people who had worked alongside Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had donated $1.4 million both directly to his campaign and to the super PAC supporting his campaign.Secretary Clinton has also received donations from employees at the U.S. State Department, which she headed from 2009 to 2013.Trump has continually lagged behind Clinton in fundraising during the election, a disparity which has shown up in underfunded campaign operations in many of the key swing states and a severe lack of television advertising. Trump claimed he would self-fund his campaign, but while he has donated to the enterprise, it hasn t been a significant fraction of the  billions  Trump claims to possess, a figure which cannot be independently verified because Trump won t release his tax returns.Featured image via Flickr",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

It  is the homophobia that shames and isolates LGBT youth and keeps them from life-saving healthcare and education. HIV is not just transmitted by sex,  Theron added.  It s transmitted by sexism, racism, poverty and homophobia. And if we re going to end AIDS, we have to cure the disease within our own hearts and within our own minds first.  -BreitbartThis certainly isn t the first time the rabid anti-gun actress has made the news (well almost) for making a completely unfounded  and idiotic comment. In May, 2014, Theron compared the media s coverage of her to  rape . When asked by Sky News whether she ever Googled herself, Theron replied,  I don t do that, so that s my saving grace. When you start living in that world, and doing that, you start, I guess, feeling raped. Critics went wild over her twisted analogy. But in the end, she s a Hollywood liberal and much like their good friend in the White House, they re untouchable.

"GOP Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska has been one of Trump s most vocal critics in the Republican Party. He s also adamant that he s not going to the GOP convention this year; it seems he doesn t want to expose his kids to Trump. He doesn t want to have anything to do with Trump, and he s going to nope the hell on out of there.To make his point, his spokesperson told The Hill the following: Sen. Sasse will not be attending the convention and will instead take his kids to watch some dumpster fires across the state, all of which enjoy more popularity than the current front-runners. Burn! That hurts. When Trump met with GOP Senators on Thursday, things got heated when he decided that was just the peachiest of times to criticize Senators that don t like him, instead of, oh, actually behaving in a presidential manner and talking strategy, platform and other important things. Sasse is one of the louder members of the  Never Trump  movement, and one of the Senators that Trump felt it appropriate to excoriate.There is nothing more important to His Royal Narcissist than how many people bow and scrape before his really gross little feet. Those who resist? He ll make sure they regret it.Sasse isn t the only one to have a snarky response for not attending the convention. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) said he ll be mowing his lawn, and Steve Daines (R-MT) will be fly-fishing rather than doing anything to help Trump along. These have to be the three most insulting reasons for not helping to officially crown the Fascist-in-Chief.Sasse s spokesperson invoked dumpster fires again when explaining why Sasse cannot and will not vote for Trump: Mr. Sasse continues to believe that our country is in a bad place, and, with these two candidates, this election remains a dumpster fire. The burns just keep coming, and from a GOP Senator, are absolutely amazing.Featured image by Zach Gibson/Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Brigitte Gabriel was born in the Marjeyoun District of Lebanon to a Maronite Christian couple, a first and only child after over twenty years of marriage. She recalls that during the Lebanese Civil War, Islamic militants launched an assault on a Lebanese military base near her family s house and destroyed her home. Gabriel, who was ten years old at the time, was injured by shrapnel in the attack. She says that she and her parents were forced to live underground in all that remained, an 8-by-10-foot (2.4 by 3.0 m) bomb shelter for seven years, with only a small kerosene heater, no sanitary systems, no electricity or running water, and little food. She says she had to crawl in a roadside ditch to a spring for water to evade Muslim snipers.According to Gabriel, at one point in the spring of 1978, a bomb explosion caused her and her parents to become trapped in the shelter for two days.They were eventually rescued by three Christian militia fighters.Brigitte Gabriel is now an American citizen, author, founder of ACT and a conservative lecturer. Gabriel attended a Benghazi Accountability Coalition forum that was supposed to be about Benghazi and how our government should be held responsible for their actions that led to the deaths of four Americans, but things took a dramatic turn when a Saba Ahmed, a Muslim law student in an America university stood up to defend the  majority of followers of Islam.  She told the panel,  We portray Islam and all Muslims as bad, but there are 1.8 billion followers of Islam. We have 8 million plus Muslim Americans in this country and I don t see them represented here.  Gabriel answered her question from a historical perspective and knocked it out of the park! She gave an answer that Ahmed, who it turns out, is a Islamic activist who was also very active in Democratic politics at the time this event took place.Watch:",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

"Every day Barack Obama rubs his radical transformation of America in our noses as we sit back and watch Republican Presidential candidates tear each other apart over comments they make about each other This Sunday marks three days since an Islamist gunman opened fire Thursday on military facilities in Chattanooga, Tennessee, killing five unarmed servicemen and wounding a policeman.President Barack Obama still has not ordered the lowering of the U.S. flag to half-staff at the White House and federal properties as a sign of respect and mourning for those killed, even though he (and former President George W. Bush) did so for previous mass killings by lone gunmen.In contrast it was only a matter of hours after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage last month before Obama bathed the White House in the rainbow hues of the LGBTQ movement.Also, Obama issued same-day orders lowering the flag following the the July 20, 2012 Aurora, Colorado mass shooting, December 14, 2012 Sandy Hook, Connecticut mass shooting and the September 16, 2013 Washington Navy Yard mass shooting.Obama ordered the flag flown at half-staff the day after the November 5, 2009 Fort Hood, Texas massacre.President George W. Bush ordered the flag lowered for the April 16, 2007 Virginia Tech massacre the day after that attack.Obama apparently did not order flags lowered following the Charleston mass shooting last month, however he went to Charleston and delivered the eulogy at the funeral for the Reverend Clementa Pinckney. Several state governors did issue orders to lower flags in their respective states to honor the Charleston victims.Obama s selectivity on whether to honor victims of terror attacks or mass shootings was in evidence in May when Obama made no public or written statement on the Islamist terror attack in Garland, Texas.Obama vacationed in New York City this weekend. Meanwhile several state governors took steps to arm National Guard troops under their command and issued proclamations ordering flags in their respective states be flown at half-staff to honor those killed in the Chattanooga attack.The Pentagon said the day after the attack it would continue to leave recruiters unarmed and unprotected, and ordered Marine recruiters to not wear their uniforms to work.Via: Gateway Pundit",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

It was not clear if the strikes targeted ISIS, Al Qaeda or other forces opposed to Assad, who Moscow is aiding. According to a Twitter handle belonging to the Syrian government, the Russian strikes were initiated at the request of Assad.The development came after Pentagon officials brushed aside an official request from Russia to clear air space over northern Syria, where Moscow intends to conduct airstrikes against ISIS on behalf of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, according to sources who spoke to Fox News.The request was made by a Russian three-star general who spoke with U.S. officials at the American embassy in Baghdad, sources said.

"Ever since same-sex marriage became the law of the land, Bible Belt states have been pushing back on it. Of course, we all remember the Kim Davis fiasco, where the Rowan County, Kentucky County Clerk went to jail rather than issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Now, we have something similar happening in Arkansas, where the state was refusing to put the names of same-sex parents on their children s birth certificates. However, the Supreme Court handed down a decision forcing the state of Arkansas to treat same-sex couples just like they treat opposite-sex couples.The decision that was handed down was 6-3, with Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch dissenting. This comes as no surprise, since those are the three most conservative justices on the court. Further, it gives us just a taste of what we are in for with Trump s new justice, and it isn t good. The case reached the highest court in the land as the result of two women who filed a suit against the state when they insisted that it was not a right to have both parents listed on their infant s certificate of birth. First, the Arkansas Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state, so the case went to the Supreme Court, where it was struck down.Luckily, this is a 6-3 ruling, so it s not on a razor s edge, like some rulings in favor of equality have been   including Obergefell v. Hodges, the case that legalized marriage equality nationwide. With talk of the potential retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is usually the swing vote on the Court, there could be a lot of anti-equality rulings if Trump puts another right-wing asshole up for consideration. The last great hope is that the Democrats are able to take the Senate back in 2018, and Justice Kennedy will wait until then to retire. For now, we can be happy that the Court did the right thing in this case.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
" Friends of Bill Long-secret emails just caught Team Hillary in another blatant lie   namely, the claim that Clinton Foundation donors got no special treatment from Clinton s State Department. In fact, ABC s  case study  of the 2010 Haiti-relief feeding frenzy may be the most damning foundation scoop yet.And the foundation isn t even denying it.ABC News got the emails via a Freedom of Information lawsuit. They show that, after the devastating 2010 Haiti earthquake, a top Hillary aide repeatedly gave special attention to  Friends of Bill  looking to cash in.Indeed, the aide, Caitlin Klevorick, kept asking foundation official Amitabh Desai  to flag when people are friends of WJC    William Jefferson Clinton. Anyone without a special tag (FOB, WJC-VIP) got rebuffed by State and referred to a federal website.State was besieged with requests to get in on $10 billion in aid contracts, described in one government cable as  a gold rush. One FOB, a major foundation donor who d served as Bill s Texas chair, used his pull on behalf of a firm he admitted  wanted to get some of the business  and had him use the Clinton Foundation as  a facilitator. Klevorick told ABC the special attention was about learning who had a history in Haiti so as  to get the necessary resources to the right places as soon as possible to save lives. One problem: She never asked if anyone had experience in Haiti or even with aid relief. Her only question:  Is this a FOB?  And her only instruction to the foundation was that all FOBs be  flagged. Which is why the Haiti analyst for the nonpartisan Center for Economic and Policy says,  The line was pretty faint between  the foundation and the State Department.Even if the Clintons follow through on their vow to put  disinterested  third parties in charge at the foundation, this is a warning of how a Clinton White House would work   because political favoritism and corruption are just how Bill and Hillary roll.Via: NYP",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

"Obama does it again he put his potical agenda before the American people! He s determined to fulfill his promise to close GITMO by releasing  the worst of the worst  of the terrorists currently jailed.The Obama administration has quietly seeded the diplomatic bed for its next push to transfer detainees out of Guant namo Bay, the Guardian has learned, as Barack Obama aims to reduce the prison s population before leaving office.According to US officials, the administration has deals in place to send approximately two dozen longtime Guant namo detainees to about half a dozen countries.While it is unclear if the transfers will occur in one wave, as with the April transfer of nine detainees to Saudi Arabia, there is an expectation that the departure of 22 or 23 men will occur by the end of July. There are currently 80 men detained at Guant namo, the lowest number since the US opened the wartime prison in 2002.All the detainees for whom US diplomats have secured arrangements to leave Guant namo have been officially approved for transfer, either by a 2010 internal review process or through quasi-parole hearings known as Periodic Review Boards.The US holds 28 detainees approved for transfer, so the men s departure would nearly empty Guant namo of such designated detainees, substantially clearing a backlog that has lasted years.Officials spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, as not all of the foreign destination countries are ready to be identified. Furthermore, some of the transfer approvals have yet to receive certification by Ashton Carter, the defense secretary, as required by law, ahead of a notification to Congress.The State Department s envoy for closing Guant namo, Lee Wolosky, pledged in January after a transfer of 10 detainees to Oman that the US would finish emptying Guant namo of transfer-eligible detainees  by this summer .If the current deals go through, the US would be left with 57 or 58 Guant namo detainees, the vast majority of whom are either involved in the military tribunals process or subject to insufficient untainted evidence to charge, while thought too dangerous to release.Read more: The Guardian",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"The White House has warned Donald Trump not to turn his attacks to Michelle Obama, or things could get quite rough for him. I can t think of a bolder way for Donald Trump to lose even more standing than he already has than by engaging the First Lady of the United States,  principal deputy White House press secretary Eric Schultz told reporters aboard Air Force One. To date, The Donald has largely stayed away from attacking the First Lady, with his one reference to her   a blatantly false claim that she attacked Clinton in political ads   only serving to embarrass him. I ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I ve ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary,  Trump said at the debate, earning him a collective eyeroll from America and a  false  from PolitiFact. In reality, Obama has campaigned hard for Clinton.Schultz is right: if Trump begins attacking the First Lady, a woman who is admired by people on both sides of the political aisle and who (for the most part) avoids engaging in politics, it will show that he truly has no shame   if The Wall, a proposed Muslim ban, grabbing women  by the pussy,  courting white supremacists, and a f*cking child rape case had not managed to make that clear already.Schultz s warning is a good one: there is nothing The Donald can do strip what little legitimacy his campaign has ever had than to attack a woman whose primary concern for the last eight years has been making sure children are educated and fed. The blowback would be something even Trump could not handle.Of course, Trump will likely view this as a challenge   but even if he doesn t go on the attack, his  deplorables have had him covered in that area for years.On Thursday, Michelle Obama didn t attack Trump, but she very poignantly pointed out exactly how awful he is.

"Ted Cruz is a guy who s easy to make fun of and SNL had a field day with him and his campaign last night. Taran Killam, who played the Republican presidential candidate, delivered a hilarious performance. Kallam as Cruz said:  Some of you may have seen me in tonight s Republican debates in New Hampshire. And if you missed it, here s a quick recap: I won. I also won the Iowa Caucuses thanks to endorsements from strong conservatives like Glenn Beck and God almighty. Cruz s  win , of course, had nothing to do with God but more to do with some nasty trickery. For example, there was Cruz s campaign telling voters that Ben Carson had dropped out of the race. Then of course, there were the mailers sent by the Cruz campaign which tried to manipulate voters into voting for him.Killam as Cruz said he was an  unconventional candidate : I didn t get where I am today because I was born wealthy or handsome or charismatic or nice. I am not cool or likable or even fine. Cruz shouldn t be blamed for his looks, being born without wealth, or even his lack of charisma. However, there are certainly some things he can do to make him more likable to folks. People don t like being lied to, nor do they like to be manipulated and it looks like Ted Cruz is a master at that.

"The era of  too big to fail  might actually be coming to an end. Not because of legislators railing against it constantly, or because of economic experts educating us as to why it s a bad idea. We ve been having this for years now, and the problem has only grown worse.Now there is actually some muscle in the fight, and it s going to scare the hell out of the big banks that have enjoyed having their greed go unchallenged for decades. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President, Neel Kashkari, has come out against the idea of  too big to fail  being allowed to continue and grow worse.A movement from within the Federal Reserve to break up big banks could actually work, due to how closely the Fed is intertwined with them. It isn t like the same old game of Democrats railing against the system, and Republicans doing everything they can to protect the banks  ability to abuse it. Kashkari made a strong comparison of reigning in the big banks to managing a nuclear reactor: The cost to society of letting a reactor melt down is astronomical. Given that cost, governments will do whatever they can to stabilize the reactor before they lose control. Source: BloombergKashkari said that the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank will be collecting public and financial industry input, then formulating proposals to address the problems with our current banking system. All options are on the table from breaking up the big banks into  less connected, less important entities,  forcing banks to hold large amounts of capital instead of gambling it on wall street   which would make them virtually incapable of failing, and using tax methods to discourage banks from taking huge risks with regular people s money.It s worth noting that Kashkari is no left-wing democratic socialist. He is a Republican who was the senior advisor to George W. Bush s treasury secretary and managed the $700 billion TARP bank bailout. Even he knows that the status-quo is unsustainable, and if a problem happens again it will be even worse.With Republicans busy being apologists for American banking cartels, and doing everything they can to make it legal for them to steal the nation away from its people, the response from Kashkari is exactly what we need. Banks can t buy the Federal Reserve for a few tens of thousands in campaign donations, which will make it difficult for Republicans to resist.Watch Kashkari s full comments below:Featured image via video screen capture",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

Perhaps this little video or  nugget of truth  slipped their minds?Despite mounting criticism for Donald Trump s failure to disavow former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke s support, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton once heaped praise for late Klan leader Sen. Robert Byrd.In a video uploaded to the State Department s official YouTube page on June 28, 2010, Clinton commemorated late Sen. Byrd by saying,  Today our country has lost a true American original, my friend and mentor Robert C. Byrd. Via: Daily CallerAnd when the former KKK member, Senator Robert Byrd died, Barack Obama gave the eulogy:President Obama lauded the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd today for keeping faith with his family, his state of West Virginia and his beloved U.S. Constitution. He was a Senate icon, he was a party leader, he was an elder statesman, and he was my friend,  Obama told thousands who gathered for Byrd s funeral on the steps of the golden-domed West Virginia statehouse.  That s how I ll remember him. ",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Another day, another situation where a Catholic priest is caught being a pervert. Monsingor Lawrence McGovern is the head of the Presentation Parish in Stockton, California. He also clearly has a proclivity for gentlemen. McGovern allegedly sent photos of his penis to an unnamed man who takes care of the swimming pool at the parish. The man complained about McGovern s sexual harassment to the police, and the parish, in true Catholic fashion, fired him.Vince Vinaldi is a lawyer for the fired pool man, and he says of the situation: It s extremely disturbing that the person s who is head of this parish would be sending text with photographs of his exposed genitals. Someone s who s engaging in that type of conduct has very, very serious credibility issues and issues with judgement. Finaldi also says that the pool man approached McGovern about the explicit material that he was receiving, and also pointed out that Catholic priests are supposed to be completely celibate. The perverted priest simply responded, Oh, that just means that you re not married. Last I checked, celibacy in modern times refers to abstaining from sexual activity, not marriage.The Stockton Parish suspended McGovern once the allegations hit the news, and issued the usual generic statement regarding a supposed internal investigation: Today the Diocese of Stockton learned for the first time of employment related allegations against Monsignor Lawrence McGovern, the Pastor of Presentation Parish in Stockton. In accordance with the Canon Law of the Church, Bishop Stephen Blaire has placed Monsignor McGovern on administrative leave pending a full and complete investigation. Vince Finaldi, however, has a much more appropriate reaction than that of the local diocese: That person has no business being in a parish and head of a school where there are numerous young children walking around everyday. Unfortunately, Mr. Finaldi, if all of these pedophiles and other assorted perverts were to be dismissed as they should be, there would be very few priests left in the Catholic Church worldwide, and there s no way the Church would allow for that. Likely, McGovern will just be shuttled away to a different parish after the media storm dies down, free to sexually harass another day.Watch a news report on the developing situation, via local station Fox 40: Featured image via video screen capture",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Donald Trump s deplorable supporters strike again.18-year-old Yasmin Seweid was born in Brooklyn, New York. So she has been raised in America her entire life. She grew up surrounded by American culture and values religious freedom as guaranteed by the Constitution.And that is why she is able to wear a hijab and practice Islam.But while she was standing on the subway platform waiting to go home, three male Trump supporters targeted her and began harassing her. They called her a  terrorist,  ripped the straps on her bag, and tried to forcibly remove her hijab all while saying Trump s name.The abuse continued on the train and Seweid was forced to exit at an early stop in order to get away from them. Bystanders even watched the incident unfold and cowardly did nothing to stop it.She reported the incident to police, who are investigating the crime.In order to warn others about the dangers of Trump supporters, Seweid chose to write about her horrific experience on Facebook. I take the train every single day going to & coming from class, but yesterday, something happened that I never thought would happen to me,  Seweid wrote.  I was harassed on the subway last night and it was just so dehumanizing I can t speak about it without getting emotional. Three white racists ripped the straps off my bag & attempted to yank my hijab off my head. They yelled such disgusting slurs at me, I was so helpless and felt defenseless.  Look it s a fucking terrorist ,  go back to your country ,  take that rag off your head  and so many more. Trump s name was repeatedly said & it finally clicked in my head. No matter how  cultured  or  Americanized  I am, these people don t see me as an American.It breaks my heart that so many individuals chose to be bystanders while watching me get harassed verbally and physically by these disgusting pigs. Trump America is real and I witnessed it first hand last night! What a traumatizing night. Please stay safe everyone & never let anyone take your rights away. Just thought I should share that with you all tonight.Here s her full post via Facebook.Ever since Election Day, Trump supporters have been celebrating by committing hate crimes against women and minorities. In fact, the number of hate crimes skyrocketed and nearly 900 of them have been committed in the weeks since November 8th. And experts say it is worse than the number of hate crimes committed after the 9/11 attacks.Donald Trump has done nothing more than create an atmosphere of hate and violence in this country. With that being said, his call for unity is complete bullshit. We can t have unity in this country when his own supporters are going around terrorizing people.Featured Image: Steve Pope/Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"The Department of Homeland Security announced its plans to build a 15-mile prototype of the border wall in San Diego.The department issued a waiver from numerous environmental laws and regulations to build the wall with  robust physical characteristics  to prevent illegal immigration crossings in an area of  high illegal entry. The Department is implementing President Trump s Executive Order 13767, Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements, and continues to take steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border,  the department said in a statement Tuesday announcing plans to issue the waiver.In one of his last moves as DHS secretary, Gen. John Kelly signed the notice on July 26, before he was tapped to serve as White House chief of staff.The waiver was published in the Federal Register on Wednesday.The notice outlines the plans for projects along a 15-mile stretch along the Southwestern border in the San Diego sector. The department said the area is in need of further border protection immediately, as it is the site of over 31,000 illegal alien apprehensions, the seizure of 9,167 pounds of marijuana, and approximately 1,317 pounds of cocaine last year alone. The construction of border wall prototypes in the Project Area and the robust physical characteristics that are to be incorporated into the border wall prototypes are intended to deter illegal crossings,  the notice states.The department will waive several environmental regulations to build the prototype wall, including the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, and a host of others.DHS said it is still committed to safeguarding the environment but is eliminating onerous rules that would delay construction.For entire story: Washington Free Beacon",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Black lives matter but only when white cops are responsible for their deaths. When blacks kill other blacks not so much.  Kudos to the Fred L. Davis Insurance Company for telling the truth about who s really doing the killing in black communities.That s the statement on a billboard in Memphis, Tennessee. However, there s more to it.The full message reads:  Black lives matter. So let s quit killing each other.  It s a statement directed against black-on-black crime.Normally, liberals take umbrage at the idea that somebody might evaluate problems caused within the black community by other blacks because it doesn t suit the narrative. However, the author of this message has a background that will make it difficult for people to attack him like that.Fred Davis is a civil rights activist who reportedly marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He s also the man behind the message.  We re going to have to wake up,  Davis said.  We re going to have to say to ourselves that black lives matter, and we re going to have to refrain from killing each other out of our own frustration.

" It s no wonder that Fusion GPS wants to block documents from coming out. The newest unsealed documents are explosive enough with the revelation that there was a payoff to three reporters to push negative news on Trump. Who are the three journalists? Well, Fusion GPS wants that to remain a secret Unsealed court documents reveal that the firm behind the salacious 34-page Trump-Russia Dossier, Fusion GPS, was paid $523,000 by a Russian businessman convicted of tax fraud and money laundering, whose lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was a key figure in the infamous June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower arranged by Fusion GPS associate Rob Goldstone.In short, D.C. opposition research firm Fusion GPS is the common denominator linked to two schemes used to damage the Trump campaign.PAYOFF TO THREE JOURNALISTS:Newly filed court documents confirm that Fusion GPS, the company mostly responsible for the controversial  Trump dossier  on presidential candidate Donald Trump, made payments to three journalists between June 2016 until February 2017.The revelation could be a breakthrough for House Republicans, who are exploring whether Fusion GPS used the dossier, which was later criticized for having inaccurate information on Trump, to feed anti-Trump stories to the press during and after the presidential campaign. The three journalists who were paid by Fusion GPS are known to have reported on  Russia issues relevant to [the committee s] investigation,  the House Intelligence Committee said in a court filing.REDACTED DOCUMENTS AND RESTRAINING ORDERS:But the recipients  names, the amounts, and purposes of those payments were either redacted from the documents that Fusion GPS filed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or were not disclosed.Fusion has asked the court to issue a restraining order against the House committee, which is demanding documents from the company that, among other things, explain the payments it made to reporters.

"Judge Sri Srinivasan is a possible pick for Obama to replace Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court. We only know one particular case where he paved the way for gay marriage. Social issues like abortion and gay marriage are BIG sticking points for conservatives. Could a judge who has no track record on social issues be appointed by Obama? This would be a smart move on Obama s part because there would be no ammunition for declining this nominee. One possible contender to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court is an Indian-American appeals court judge, Sri Srinivasan, who has pro-business credentials and a stellar resume.If he was nominated his background may make it more politically challenging for Republicans as they plan to block anyone put forward by President Barack Obama.Srinivasan, 48, has served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since he was confirmed on a 97-0 bipartisan vote in the U.S. Senate in May 2013. Republican senators who supported him then would likely be asked to justify why they couldn t back him for the Supreme Court.Many names are likely under consideration and the White House has not tipped its hand, but recent Supreme Court appointments have tended to be appeals court judges and the appeals court in Washington on which Srinivasan serves has often been a springboard to the high court. Scalia himself served on the court, as did other Supreme Court members Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.The White House said on Sunday that Obama will wait until the U.S. Senate is back in session before making a nomination. The Senate returns from recess on Feb. 22.Republicans have called for Scalia s seat to remain open so that the next president, who would take office in January 2017, can nominate a replacement. Other judges Obama could consider appointing include Paul Watford, a black man who serves on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and Jacqueline Nguyen, a Vietnamese-American woman who serves on the same court as Watford.Little is known about Srinivasan s views on divisive social issues like abortion and affirmative action. But as a senior Justice Department lawyer in 2013, he was part of the legal team that successfully urged the high court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act, a law that restricted the definition of marriage to heterosexual couples for the purposes of federal benefits. The ruling helped pave the way for the court s ruling in June 2015 that legalized gay marriage nationwide.Via: Reuters",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

If there s nothing found here and if there s not even a recount will you pledge tonight that you and others in the Green Party believe that that money should be refunded, so this is not just money being raised on false hope?JACKSON: Well, we re exploring that I m only treasurer for the Green-Rainbow party.

"Donald Trump and his campaign have been scrambling to do damage control after his multiple attacks on the Khans, Gold Star parents whose Muslim son died fighting for his country.

In a segment about Trump s latest attempt to fool America, she had a direct message for Trump supporters: wake the f*** up. Brzezinski insisted that Trump s entire campaign was a  scam  and his meeting with these families was no different   Trump was just trying to fool gullible Americans into believing that he cares about things other than himself.Visibly upset that a person running for president would do something so heartless and take advantage of trusting Americans this way, the MSNBC host said: I m just trying to   because, look, Trump supporters, people who support Donald Trump, are people who should be respected for how they feel.

But I will say that it s a scam, what Trump is selling. Remarking on just how heartless Trump s attacks had been on the Khans, Brzezinski urged voters not to be fooled.

"It s gotten to the point that if you re still considering voting for Donald Trump in November, you ve got to be completely fine with voting for a scam artist and a misogynistic racist. Now, if those are things that you can overlook because of the simplistic view of party line politics, well, that s just sad, but it s your vote.Pointing out Trump s blatant racism, and ever-obvious scam artist antics is Seth Meyers on Late Night during a segment he calls  A Closer Look.  Meyers informed his audience of what Trump University is   fraud.He said: Trump University was founded in 2005, promising to teach people how to make money off real estate. But, as the Washington Post reported, it wasn t a university or even a school; it was just  a series of seminars held in hotel ballrooms across the country.' Meyers then compared getting a degree in business at Trump University is about as valid as getting a medical degree at the Holiday Inn Express. He also pointed out that Trump University is so bad, and so fraudulent, that it scammed mothers trying to feed their kids and even Bernie Madoff would say,  Wow, dog, that s not cool. Not only did Meyers go elbow deep into describing how much of a scam artist Trump is, but also how racist he is. He perfectly summarized it with this one statement: Now to be clear, claiming that someone is not able to do their job because of their race is, by definition, racism. Period. And in regards to Trump pointing and calling out his  African-American  and Republicans all of a sudden seeming to realize Trump is racist, Meyers said: Republicans can t pretend to suddenly be shocked and offended, this is who Trump was well before this latest outburst, and this is who [the GOP is] lining up to support  So remember this when Trump inevitably tries to convince you he s not a racist.

"In June of 2016, the disgraced sexual predator, and Hollywood producer, Harvey Weinstein, hosted a fundraiser for Hillary s presidential campaign in Manhattan. Some of the top celebrities in the business accepted Harvey s invitation to the event. Celebrity donors who were in attendance at the event included Leo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lopez, and Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick. Weinstein raised $1.8 million for Hillary at his star-studded fundraiser. When Hillary was asked if she was planning to give any of the money back or would give it to charity, the Clinton Foundation claimed they would not give back a cent, and that the money had already been spent on other  charitable purposes .  We re wondering what, exactly the Clinton Foundation means by  charitable purposes ?  Like Chelsea s wedding that was partially funded by the Clinton Foundation?A TV writer and close Clinton family friend says she warned at least three  top-level Democratic operatives  against allowing Harvey Weinstein to host fundraisers. A warning that evidently (and to the glee of Fox News) fell on deaf ears,  writes  Designing Women  creator Linda Bloodworth-Thomason in a new Hollywood Reporter op-ed.Weinstein gave thousands and bundled $1.42 million in donations to Hillary Clinton s presidential run, but the former secretary of state has said she had no idea about the producer s predatory ways.Bloodworth-Thomason, who has created political promotional films for both Clintons, said she helped President Bill Clinton pen an apology amid his own sex scandal and that his actions have  taxed my feminist conscience    but she still loves him  dearly. She says she has long been aware of Weinstein s lecherous ways and is skeptical of those now claiming ignorance. Some said this despite knowing him for decades, starring in his films and being friends with accusers who starred in his films,  she writes.But although Weinstein was  at the top of the sexual predator food chain  she says the industry is rife with men like him. These kinds of atrocities against women routinely go unreported and unpunished in the entertainment industry. The No. 1 casting criterion in Hollywood is that, above all else, an actress must be  hot and f kable,  she writes.  Page Six ",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"The director of the Anti-LGBT group the Family Research Council had an interview with Chris Mathews that he probably should not have shown up for. Travis Webber, who is the director of the Center for Religious Liberty at Family Research Council, seemed quite incapable in this interview, constantly dancing around and attempting to avoid a valid question by MSNBC host Chris Mathews on which bathroom he would suggest for trans activist Jennifer Finney Boyland.The conversation got started when Boyland pointed out that the conservative push on bathrooms was simply an attempt to make up for lost ground after they lost the same-sex marriage battle. Boyland said: I don t think this is about bathrooms at all. I think it s about equal rights. Transgender people don t want special rights. We want equal protection under the law, and mostly what we want is to be left alone. And if we can t be left alone, we d like to be treated with love. So you don t want me in the men s room. And you know how you create that perfect situation? Just stop. Stop coming up with these laws. Stop causing trouble where there is no trouble. Maybe because now gay men and lesbians can get married, and they re no longer the whipping boys and whipping girls in this country, now maybe they re trying to rile up people against transgender people. And it s not right, and it s not fair. That s when host Chris Mathews jumped in, putting Webber on the spot, asking him,  Travis, tell Jenny what bathroom she should use. That s when Webber stumbled and paused, at one point saying,  Yeah, I mean I m not sure, um  .  Mathews then said,  Well just answer that question. Travis continued to avoid the question with a response that had nothing to do with the question, prompting Mathews to include,  See, no, you can t answer the question, can you? Webber s inability to respond to a valid question is indicative of the way conservatives have handled this issue and many others. One thread to notice about these so-called conservative GOP folks is their constant attempt to divide and deny people their rights. Whether it s supporting discrimination for same-sex couples, banning Muslims, building walls, denying rights to transgender Americans, or supporting an apartheid state like Israel which denies Palestinians human rights, the conclusion about conservatives must be that they are crazy.Watch the video here: Featured image via video screen capture",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

"Fox News is literally pretending that they treated President Obama with nothing but respect.The reality, however, is the complete opposite as Fox News and Republicans spent eight years calling President Obama an illegitimate president and working against him to make him fail.They rejected President Obama s call for unity from the very beginning, questioned his citizenship, obstructed, demonized, and whined.Fox News served as the Republican s anti-Obama propaganda machine for all eight years.But now that Donald Trump is being given the same treatment across the country, Fox News is throwing a hissy fit about it.They expect everyone across the country to bow down and kiss Trump s ass and anyone who doesn t do so is branded as a traitor or un-American.It s hypocrisy of the highest order.That s why the Huffington Post put together a wonderful little video showcasing Fox News hosts flip-flopping repeatedly. It s the kind of thing that Jon Stewart would have done if he had never retired from the Daily Show.The video shows hosts like Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, and Bill O Reilly complaining about anti-Trump protesters complete with flashbacks of all three being vehemently anti-Obama. Hannity even uses the term  not my president  to express his hatred of Obama.Here s the video via Huffington Post.Fox News is full of hypocrites. They are whining about the anti-Trump movement and ignoring the fact that conservatives did even worse to President Obama over eight years.When President Obama extended his hand Fox News slapped it away and denounced him as illegitimate. They pushed conspiracy theories. They called him a tyrant. They allied with Republicans to make President Obama fail and proceeded to try and sabotage him at every turn.

Keep at it!The State Department inspector general concluded that Hillary Clinton did not comply with the agency s policies on records, according to a report released to lawmakers on Wednesday that also revealed that Clinton and her top aides chose not to cooperate with the review.The agency on Wednesday released the long-awaited report to Capitol Hill, copy of which was obtained by POLITICO, providing just the latest turn in the headache-inducing saga that has dogged Clinton s campaign.While the report concludes that the agency suffers from  longstanding, systemic weaknesses  with records that  go well beyond the tenure of any one Secretary of State,  it specifically dings Clinton for her exclusive use of private email.The watchdog s findings could exact further damage to Clinton s campaign, and they provide fresh fodder for Trump, who has already said he will go after Clinton for the email scandal  bigly.  The Democratic frontrunner s bid for the White House has already been hindered by high unfavorability ratings, with people saying they don t trust her. The report represents the latest pushback   in this case by a nonpartisan government entity   against her campaign s claim that she did not break any rules and that her use of a private server was completely allowed. The report also details how some technology staff said they were instructed to not talk of Clinton s email set-up after they raised concerns about the unusual arrangement. It also includes conflicting information about whether the private email server had been approved by the State Department s legal staff. Read more: POLITICO",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"It s probably not the wisest decision to argue with Dr. Sebastian Gorka about the use of the phrase  radical Islamic terrorism    especially if you have absolutely no idea what you re talking about in the first place.Dr. Sebastian Gorka defended the Trump administration s use of the phrase  radical Islamic terrorism  in an appearance on MSNBC Tuesday. We will call it  radical Islamic terrorism. We will target the ideology, and we will call them out for being evil,  Gorka stated. MSNBC s Ali Velshi and Stephanie Ruhle then tried to criticize Gorka s use of the phrase.Velshi asked Gorka how it would help stop terror attacks if the White House called the problem  radical Islamic terrorism. Gorka then engaged a clever metaphor to help them understand. Gorka argued,  If you, God forbid, caught cancer, and the hospital was forbidden from calling it cancer and said,  You have the flu. Go home and hydrate and take some aspirins, would you actually have the right treatment?.' Ruhle responded, smugly, that there s still no cure for cancer and that it doesn t matter what you call it if it will still kill you.Velshi then accused Gorka of not having a good answer. Gorka fired back by saying that if you misdiagnose anything, whether it s a serious disease or a serious international geopolitical threat, you will never solve it. The White House Adviser then criticized the Obama administration for blaming this geopolitical issue on economic conditions and societal disenfranchisement It is about people having an ideology that is evil, and it has to be destroyed.

"Fox News host Eric Bolling had recently been filling in for his colleague Bill O Reilly on The O Reilly Factor, and he was in no way prepared for the chaos that erupted when one of his guests called Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton a  bigot. The discussion began by bringing up Donald Trump s recent comments about Clinton s polices being  bigoted  and it immediately set off Bolling s guests, who spent the majority of the segment at each other s throats despite Bolling s attempts to restore a calm discussion.Civil rights attorney Leo Terrell had hit the nail right on the head when he commented that Trump had no business calling someone else s policies  bigoted.  He said: Eric, Donald Trump doesn t know the definition of the word  bigot . You don t hear Republicans on Capitol Hill supporting Donald Trump s definition of the term  bigoted  as it applies to Hillary Clinton. It doesn t make sense, it s inexplicable. Terrell also defended Clinton, stating that when she d called out Trump s racism in a speech, her argument had been  fact-based    and that s when conservative Horace Cooper lost it and countered that Clinton s speech had been a  litany of lies. What happened next was insanity. Cooper, an African American legal commentator, said that the black community would be much better off under racist Trump. He said, It s good  that someone is finally telling the truth! Somebody needed to stand up and explain that the policies that the left and progressives have been pushing are bigoted because they don t assume there is any possibility for improvement for blacks. Terrell couldn t believe his ears and told Cooper,  You should be ashamed of yourself.  Then he asked Cooper again to answer Bolling s question,  Is Hillary Clinton a bigot? Cooper said,  absolutely,  and the two men exchanged heated words as Bolling tried to intervene. Shortly after the men got into a shouting match over Trump s popularity with the racist  alt-right  and support from the KKK, Terrell repeatedly told Cooper that he should be  ashamed  for his pro-Trump views.You can watch this chaotic discussion below: Featured image via screen capture",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"After weeks of blubbering on Twitter and into every microphone he could find about how un-American NFL players who kneel during the national anthem are, Donald Trump just did the un-American equivalent of drunkenly slapping his dick on the table in the middle of a black-tie dinner.During a self-congratulatory interview with his number one sycophant, Sean Hannity, Trump found himself absolutely bewildered by a military ceremony that his supporters have been breathlessly posting on Facebook and referring to as  what respect for the military looks like : The playing of  Retreat  on the bugle. The song is played as the American flag is brought down the pole at the end of the day and secured for the night.The Commander-in-Chief of nine months had no idea what was happening as the song began to play. As it begins, he first jokes with the human pile of shit he s sitting across from, then turns to play to the audience: What a nice sound that is. Are they playing that for you or for me? They re playing that in honor of his ratings! Did you see how good his ratings were? He s beating everybody! Now, it s not like Donald Trump was  in uniform  as the official leader of America s military while he sat there with the second-biggest* asshole on television. But the fact remains that it s his title, especially in a setting where servicemembers are present. One military newspaper, Georgia s Fort Gordon Globe, describes expected behavior like so:Screen captureI think you ll note I didn t describe Donald Trump doing anything even close to any of that whatsoever as the bugle played its end-of-day call. You can watch for yourself:Complete ignorance of military custom is nothing less than exactly what I would expect out of hypocritical Donald Trump. He s been freaking out about NFL players   who are protesting for their very lives   silently kneeling or sitting during the national anthem for weeks now. He s appealed to their bosses, he s attempted to turn America against them, and he s generally been the most racist asshat on the planet about the whole process.Now we see that his offense at the NFL protests had nothing to do with patriotism, but with trying to dictate where and when it was okay for black people to protest.*the biggest asshole on television without question is Pat RobertsonFeatured image via Stephen Chernin/Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"There are a lot of polls out there, a lot of research, and it s hard to discern what s real from the signal-to-noise ratio. That s why, as a general rule, I prefer to read studies, polls, academic papers   the things meant to educate me   from people who aren t getting paid to produce them. Not that a paycheck is bad, mind you. It just creates a motive for a certain outcome that usually aligns with the checkbook holder s opinion. The Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) is a non-profit whose focus I suppose you can probably guess.The newest paper from PRRI comes on the heels of Trump s directive to the DOJ to begin investigating universities for discriminating against white people. Like all Republicans, Trump believes that Affirmative Action, by leveling the playing field, actually tilts it in favor of people of color.That s asinine, but I guarantee that you   whoever you are, reading this  you know someone who thinks the same thing.In fact, that was the focus of PRRI s latest research. This graph shows responses from different demographics to queries on just who, exactly, is discriminated against in America.There are some interesting takeaways here: First, of course, is that Democrats are likeliest to see discrimination where it demonstrably exists. To be a partisan at least requires one to be versed in the aims of the party they favor, and Democrats aim to reduce discrimination. But even more fascinating to me are the averages, over in the  All Americans  section of the graph. This reflected the opinions of both partisan groups and those who identified as neither, combined.The fact that any respondents indicated they thought there even was discrimination against whites is hilarious to me. I personally think they re confusing  you didn t get that job  with  you kinda felt uncomfortable on the subway the other night,  but I don t really have science on my side with that informal study. But Christians? Are you kidding me? You don t even have to be a member to get their holidays off work! That kind of response makes Republicans even more heartbreakingly stupid than I thought.In literally every case, the group of Democratic respondents is closer to the views of All Americans than the group of Republicans. All of them. Look back at the graph and do the addition or subtraction. In every case, Republicans were less likely to see discrimination where it does exist and more likely to see it where it does not.Me, looking for an image for this article.

"If there s one thing Donald Trump has an extremely hard time accepting, it s evidence and facts. It doesn t matter how much proven, scientifically backed data you put in front of the undeserving POTUS   his first impulse is to whine about how biased and dishonest the information is, even when it comes to something as serious and common sense as climate change.On Friday, CNN s Jake Tapper tore Trump a new one by making fun of his denial of what is happening to our environment. In a segment on Australia s Great Barrier Reef, Tapper mocked Trump for previously calling global warming a hoax invented by the Chinese. As Tapper spoke about coral bleaching and the effects that the rising temperatures have had on the Great Barrier Reef, Tapper stated that coral bleaching was  proof that climate change, at least partially man made, is destroying the planet,  noting that  once-colorful coral reefs off the coast of Australia are now being bleached white. Then Tapper made sure that no one forgot that the current President of the United States is an absolute moron. Perfectly explaining why Trump s climate change denial is devastating, Tapper said: This news comes at a time at a time President Trump has proposed cutting billions of dollars from programs to study and help combat the effects of climate change which in the past he s called a  Chinese hoax.  It is, of course, not a Chinese hoax. It s seriously depressing to know that the man in the White House has called climate change a hoax. At a time when we cannot trust our President to make decent decisions on behalf of our country (let alone the planet), we re lucky to have reporters like Tapper reminding us that denying facts has serious consequences.

"Donald Trump and his supporters are vigorously trying to blame anyone but the billionaire conspiracy theorist Republican nominee for his birtherism. Former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer claimed on CNN this morning that there were plenty of Democrats  all over the country  that questioned President Obama s birthplace, too.Marc Morial said the birther issue  was offensive to us, it was offensive to Americans. Not so fast, you can t just sweep it under the rug. Marc Morial said that Trump  sounded like Joseph McCarthy  and added that it was a  smear campaign,  and then Brewer said it s time to move on from the subject. She actually told an African-American man that there are more important issues to talk about. Trump tried to delegitimize our country s first black president by suggesting that he s really a scary Muslim from Kenya. You can t blow that racist dog whistle any louder than that. She quoted President Obama when she said that. Obama is probably sick of discussing his birth certificate after nearly two terms in office. The President took the high road when Donald Trump took the low road on the subject.One of the CNN panelists reminded Brewer that she said years ago that the birther issue was nonsense, but  we have the Republican nominee not capable of saying it in 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2015, and then says this very thing he should have said years ago. And then he starts another lie around it,  she added.Jan Brewer baffled the panel when she went on to say that for years the birther issue,  was a feeding frenzy on both sides of the aisle.  She claimed to remember that  vividly. Jake Tapper asked Brewer,  Democrats were? Brewer said  absolutely. Watch:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3peRl_7UYA]So first Donald circulated a conspiracy theory about Obama s citizenship, then he took credit for proving that the president was not born in Kenya, and then he covered that up with another conspiracy theory saying that Hillary Clinton started his first conspiracy theory. And now, Jan Brewer is blaming Democrats.Featured image via screen capture. ",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Rep. Maxine Waters said today that if Robert Mueller  does his job  and is able to prove collusion between President Donald Trump s campaign and the Russians, then  we ve got him. In an interview with MSNBC host and self-professed Waters fan Joy Reid, Waters reiterated that Democrats needed to work to remove Trump from office. Reid asked Waters if she had a sense that more Republicans in Congress were willing to  stand up  to Trump.Waters said she felt some Republicans did not know how to handle the situation or were simply waiting for the president to  implode. Many of them are not comfortable, and I believe that if Mueller does his job, if he s able to connect the dots, if he s able to show collusion, then we ve got him,  she said.  They will move away from him. Waters, a darling of progressives due to her constant calls for Trump s impeachment, has previously likened Mueller s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election to a contest of sorts. In an appearance Friday on MSNBC, she said Mueller is  going to win. Trump has consistently stated the Mueller probe is a  witch hunt  and pointed to the partisanship of the investigators on his team, although other Republicans have said Mueller s reputation is unquestioned.On  The View  last week, Waters said she welcomed the leaks coming from Trump s White House and was  so glad they re telling us what s going on.

"In a stunning reversal, Donald Trump said that he will strengthen the rights of the LGBT community and bring people together. His new stance comes just days after he said that as president, he would   strongly consider  overturning Obergefell vs Hodges, the Supreme Court decision that found that same-sex couples have a legal and constitutional right to marry. I m a lesbian, we ve had some great progress for the gay and lesbian community,  NECN reporter  Sue O Connell told Trump. When President Trump is in office, can we look for more forward motion on equality for gays and lesbians?  Here is Trump s response: Well, you can. We re going to bring people together, and that s your thing, and other people have their thing. We have to bring all people together and if we don t we re not going to have a country anymore. Now that s one big flip-flop because in addition to Trump saying he would appoint judges to overturn Obergefell vs Hodges, he has stated in the past  time and time again that he only supports marriage between a man and a woman. He has said: I m not in favor of gay marriage. I don t feel right about marriage equality. Trump has even gone as far as to compare same-sex relationships to choosing the wrong kind of golf putter! He said:  It s like in golf. A lot of people   I don t want this to sound trivial   but a lot of people are switching to these really long putters, very unattractive. It s weird. You see these great players with these really long putters, because they can t sink three-footers anymore. And, I hate it. I am a traditionalist. I have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay, but I am a traditionalist. In trying to rationalize the irrational, it s most likely that Trump is pandering to New Hampshire voters for the primary, 67% of whom support gay marriage. Whatever his reasoning, his  new position is going to upset his bigoted right-wing conservative following.Featured image via video screen capture ",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"You just can t make this stuff up Yet another key member of Special Counsel Robert Mueller s Russia probe appears to have deep ties to the Democratic Party.From PJ Media: Aaron Zebley served previously as Mueller s chief of staff at the FBI and as a senior counselor in the National Security Division at the Department of Justice. He also served as an assistant U.S. attorney in the National Security and Terrorism Unit in Alexandria, Virginia.Also, in 2015 when he was a lawyer, he represented Justin Cooper, the IT staffer who personally set up Hillary Clinton s unsecured server in her Chappaqua home, Fox News  Tucker Carlson revealed on his show Thursday.Cooper, it so happens, is also the aide who destroyed Clinton s old BlackBerries with a hammer.Watch the brilliant television ad Ted Cruz s team made during the election, that mocked Hillary Clinton and Justin Cooper for destroying evidence of her crimes, when they smashed her Blackberrys with a hammer:Documents obtained by Fox News show that Senate investigators grew frustrated with Zebley after being repeatedly stonewalled when they were trying to set up a meeting with Cooper. Mr. Zebley telephoned Homeland Security [Committee] staff to inform them that Cooper had chosen to cancel the interview,  the documents said.In a letter to Cooper, congressional investigators complained:  We are troubled by your attorney s [referring to Zebley] complete refusal to engage the committee in a discussion about how to further assuage your concerns. Let this sink in. The same attorney who played a defensive role for Hillary Clinton was tapped by Mueller in June to play an offensive role against Clinton opponent Trump.But Zebley isn t the only questionable hire. Out of a team of fifteen lawyers, nine of them have donated to Democratic candidates. None of them seem to have Republican leanings.Jeannie Rhee, who was hired by Mueller last summer to work on the probe, was the personal attorney of Ben Rhodes and also represented the Clinton Foundation, Fox News  Laura Ingraham reported on Wednesday.",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"FBI Agents are coming forward now to voice their frustrations and concerns about FBI Director James Comey s inept policing of the FBI. Specifically, the Clinton email investigation was held up by Comey standing in the way. One of the specifics of the investigation that hindered it was that the Clinton house was never searched. The FBI always does a search of a household in an investigation. The New York FBI agents working the case were livid at the stonewalling in the Clinton case. FBI agents are now lawyering up and speaking up to tell what they know This is a textbook case where a grand jury should have convened but was not. That is appalling,  an FBI special agent who has worked public corruption and criminal cases said of the decision.  We talk about it in the office and don t know how Comey can keep going. DID ANYONE ELSE THINK THIS EXACT SAME THING:The agent was also surprised that the bureau did not bother to search Clinton s house during the investigation. We didn t search their house. We always search the house. The search should not just have been for private electronics, which contained classified material, but even for printouts of such material,  he said. There should have been a complete search of their residence,  the agent pointed out.  That the FBI did not seize devices is unbelievable. The FBI even seizes devices that have been set on fire. Another special agent for the bureau that worked counter-terrorism and criminal cases said he is offended by Comey s saying:  we  and  I ve been an investigator. The idea that the Clinton/e-mail case didn t go to a grand jury is ridiculous. According to Washington D.C. attorney Joe DiGenova, more FBI agents will be talking about the problems at bureau and specifically the handling of the Clinton case by Comey when Congress comes back into session and decides to force them to testify by subpoena. People are starting to talk. They re calling their former friends outside the bureau asking for help. We were asked to day to provide legal representation to people inside the bureau and agreed to do so and to former agents who want to come forward and talk. Comey thought this was going to go away. The most important thing of all is that the agents have decided that they are going to talk. Read more: Daily Caller",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"According to the NRA,  good guys with guns  across the nation are the last line of defense between some unspecified threat that could occur anywhere at any time, and something else. But who will protect the world from the  responsible gun owners  who prove themselves to be anything BUT responsible?In the latest instance of  responsible gun ownerness,  a Utah man found himself beaten to a pulp by people who were leaving a party at his home after he shot his girlfriend. According to ABC4 Utah, everyone was enjoying the all-night party until the unnamed man began fighting with his significant other. Overcome by emotion, he  responsibly  pulled out a handgun and demanded that partygoers leave his home.Obviously, confronted by a presumably drunk individual who thinks a gun is the best way to get people to leave a party, those present quickly left   but as they were in the driveway, they heard gunshots. Unified Police Department spokesperson Lex Bell says that the heroic individuals rushed back inside and pummeled the shooter, who left his victim with gunshot wounds to her ankle and hand, until he was unconscious.In an apparent effort to protect the shooter, the girlfriend told police that she  accidentally  shot herself while cleaning the gun   but law enforcement says that she was likely shot while trying to wrestle the gun away from her violent and crazy significant other. A friend who drove her to the hospital confirmed that her story was false. Fortunately, her injuries are not serious, though she may need surgery on her hand.According to area residents, the couple recently moved into the neighborhood   and after learning about their new neighbors, they are a bit concerned. One man, identified as  Dan,  called the incident  troublesome  because he has a family whose safety is placed at risk by the new  responsible gun owners  in the neighborhood.No charges have yet been filed, but Bell says that those who rushed in and heroically beat the living hell out of the shooter were likely, legally, justified.Watch a report on the attack below:Featured image via screengrab",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"On Tuesday, the Grammys announced their nominations for the 2018 awards shows, and there are some notable additions and snubs that make it look like the Recording Academy is getting into the business of identity politics.For the first time in 14 years, no country music acts were nominated for the top awards: record of the year, song of the year, and album of the year. Instead, the Grammys took a sharp turn towards honoring hip-hop, R&B, and funk for the top awards.According to Buzzfeed: The night s biggest category, Album of the Year, not only has majority black nominees, but also has no white male nominees for the first time in 19 years.This is also the first year the Record of the Year category is only people of color (with the exception of Justin Bieber, who is featured on Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee s  Despacito ).The Best New Artist category is also majority black this year with SZA, Khalid, and Lil Uzi Vert all gaining nominations. SZA is also this year s most Grammy-nominated woman.Rapper Jay-Z and pop singer Bruno Mars got nods in all three top categories, while rapper/singer Childish Gambino (a.k.a. Donald Glover), rapper Kendrick Lamar, and the coupling of Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee got nods in two of the top three categories. Meanwhile, rapper Logic got nominated for his anti-suicide song  1-800-273-8255  for song of the year.Objectively speaking, Jay-Z, Mars, Gambino, Lamar, Fonsi, and Yankee put out some great product this past year, and with any awards show, there are going to be some snubs. However, it appeared that Ed Sheeran, Lady Gaga, Pink, Kelly Clarkson, Kesha, and Miranda Lambert were all looked over from the top categories because of concerns about white supremacy.

Tapper responded: You ve been covering politicians for a long time. Politicians lie. It wasn t invented on Jan. 20. I ve never seen this level of falsehood, quantitatively. Tapper went on to distinguish between what happens with say, falsehoods that happened with the Obama Administration such as,  If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.  He says of the lies coming out of the Trump White House: It s conspiracy theories based on nothing that have members of his own party distancing themselves from him. Then the conversation turns to Trump s vulgarity and other fundamental affronts to basic human decency in public discourse. Tapper says of the way Trump behaved on the campaign trail and how he continues to behave: The truth of the matter is that there is no bias when it comes to facts and there s no bias when it comes to decency. It s empirically indecent to make fun of the disabled. That s just indecent. My children know better than that. The two hosts then went on to reference what we all know   which is that most of the fundamental things that make Trump so awful, we all learn not to do in grade school. Maher says:I always think about that book  Everything I Needed to Know I learned in Kindergarten.  He violates every rule. Don t lie, don t accuse people of things they re not guilty of. Don t boast. Pay your taxes. Serve your country. Don t be a racist, don t insult   like you say   the handicapped people or other people who are not as lucky to be as great looking as you are, Donald. And yet, in spite of all of these things, people still voted for this fundamentally indecent, sorry excuse for a human being. That says things about this nation that we really need to examine, should we survive this nightmare of a  presidency.

"The extremely exhausted Hillary and her extremely boring VP pick have written a book that is currently #5,301 on the Amazon books bestseller list. It s really quite laughable that with only a little more than one month until the general election, Hillary can be found desperately hawking a book nobody wants to read at a rally in a tiny community center gymnasium in Orlando with only 300 people. That would be funny in and of itself, but Hillary s desperation to sell a horrible book to a tiny and lethargic crowd (who are likely being paid to occupy seats) is not even the best part of the story.It turns out, the book reviews written by Amazon users are a must read! They re hilarious, revealing, and for the most part, when they are describing Crooked Hillary to a tee These are some of the most clever and funniest reviews you will ever see for a political book!

"The conversation regarding super delegates has been very divisive in the Democratic Party. Hillary Clinton supporters cite her overwhelming super delegate support as evidence Hillary Clinton is the best candidate, while Bernie Sanders supporters cite it as evidence of corruption and an out-of-touch party, as many of those super delegates pledged allegiance to Secretary Clinton before the primaries even began.Super delegates don t cast their votes until the convention, so counting their votes before then when they can change until then is pointless, but it is noteworthy that Bernie Sanders finally received his first endorsement in the U.S. Senate. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon wrote an op-ed in the New York Times outlining why he supports Bernie Sanders for president. In the op-ed, Senator Merkley said how he thinks both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are great candidates, but only Bernie Sanders will help us rethink how our economy and our politics work. Under President Obama s leadership, our country is fairer and more prosperous for all than it was seven years ago. But as we look toward the next administration, there is far more work to do. We need urgency. We need big ideas. We need to rethink the status quo,  wrote Senator Merkley.  It has been noted that Bernie has an uphill battle ahead of him to win the Democratic nomination. But his leadership on these issues and his willingness to fearlessly stand up to the powers that be have galvanized a grass-roots movement. People know that we don t just need better policies, we need a wholesale rethinking of how our economy and our politics work, and for whom they work.

"Now, typically no one should be mocking a teenager in their place of education, but since it is a place of education, perhaps this can be seen as the child learning something valuable. And while it s never okay to bully, pointing out to someone that they re wearing the hat of a bigoted bully should be mandatory.That being said, one high school sophomore in Portland, Maine, is catching a lot of criticism for wearing his Donald Trump  Make America Great Again  hat, and rightly so.Conner Mullen says that everyone is wearing their  Bernie pins,  so he should be able to wear his Donald Trump hat. However, his fellow classmates are apparently relentless in their taunting, and even a teacher called him out, allegedly saying,  Thank God you can t vote.  When Mullen took his grievance to the assistant principal s office, the solution offered was simply to leave the hat at home.Mullen said: I knew kids would pick on me about it, that s just kids being kids, but when the adults started doing it I thought that s problematic. This is a school that preaches equality. Oh dear. Yes, he actually said that. He just equated himself to the plight for equality because he s being teased for wearing a bigot s hat. The irony is palpable.According to Mullen, the reason he wants Trump to be president is: I want a job  where you can help people, and I ve heard Trump say how important he thinks veterans and (people in law enforcement) are. Oh, dear boy, please, oh please don t believe the pandering nonsense that comes out of Trump s mouth. And as far as his love for veterans, how much he s been supposedly giving veteran groups is highly questionable.Here s the thing, the school isn t telling him he shouldn t wear the hat, but they are suggesting if he d like to stop being relentlessly mocked for such a poor fashion decision, that he should probably just leave the hat at home. Trump is a bigot and probably the worst choice this country could ever have for the role of Commander-in-Chief.The bigger concern here is, what is this student being taught that he believes Trump is a good option? Maybe that should be the real story.Watch the story via WCSH out of Portland, Maine:Featured image via video screen capture",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"In Ohio, the District of Columbia, and 21 other states this election year, 17-year-old citizens are allowed to vote in their state s caucus or primary as long as they turn 18 by the time of the general election in November.The rule allows thousands of 17-year-olds to participate in the Democratic process of voting for the very first time in their lives, but Ohio s Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted reversed the rule, revoking the rights of the 17-year-olds from voting in the state s primary on March 15th. It will be a key battleground state between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders in the Democratic Primary, and among the Republican presidential candidates, as current Ohio Republican Governor John Kasich will try to make his mark on the primaries by winning his home state.His argument was the primaries were electing delegates who will eventually elect a nominee for their party at a the party conventions later this year. Husted is distorting the language surrounding the rule which allowed 17-year-olds to vote early by alleging the 17-year-olds can nominate a candidate, but not elect one for office.The Secretary of State before Jon Husted, Jennifer Brunner, allowed 17-year-olds to participate in the 2008 primary election.  Ohio s pro-voter practice that welcomes young adults into the process has been on the books since 1981,  said State Rep. Kathleen Clyde (D-Kent) in a statement on Husted s recent change in the rules. Secretary Husted s latest underhanded, backroom attack on our most fundamental freedom should have us all concerned   about this and about his repeated claims he has made it easier to vote in Ohio   when in fact he continues to find ways to make it harder. This is not the first time Republican Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted has tried to restrict voter access in Ohio. He was sued last year by students for restricting voter rights, put restrictions on early voting in the state, and continues to impede on voters  rights in the state of Ohio. The right to vote should be facilitated, not restricted, but leave it up to the Republicans to try to make distorted arguments and reasoning for making what should be a no brainer of opening up young people to the Democratic process and encouraging voting, an issue legislators have to waste time arguing over.Featured image via Addicting Info",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"So a woman straps an  apparatus  to her person, claims she s a man and expects airport security to treat her with kit gloves because she s entitled to special privileges? If you come through airport security with something foreign strapped to your body, why should you be entitled to special treatment?

I explained to the officer at the scanner that I am trans and that I was wearing a prosthetic, to which he responded that he would need to get his supervisor,  the complaint reads. In full view of other travellers, the supervisor approached me putting rubber gloves on,  the passenger wrote.  When I asked him what the gloves were for, he told me that he was going to do a  private search . After entering a small room with the two men, the passenger pulled out the prosthetic for the men to see, and the supervisor put on a second glove.When again asked what the gloves were for, the supervisor responded,  You want me to touch that thing with my bare hands? After placing the prosthetic in a tray and undergoing a pat-down, the supervisor opened the door for the passenger to leave. My prosthetic [was] still sitting in the tray. I asked him to close the door so that I could have some privacy,  the complaint reads.  He closed the door and both men stood watching me as I put it back in place.

"The Clampetts are at it again! As usual, the  responsible  gun owning population can t make it a single day without shooting or threatening to shoot someone over something nonsensical. On Saturday, one brave patriot decided that two men waiting to harvest the meat from an animal someone hit along a Montana highway were getting just a bit too greedy   so he proposed a Second Amendment Solution to the problem.An elk had been hit by a car earlier in the day, and two men stopped to wait for it to die so they could grab it, take it home, and salvage the meat from its corpse. Sure, eating roadkill is something one would not expect to create an issue in 2016   but a third man apparently got a bit jealous over the bounty of road splatter.As the men waited, somehow unwilling to put the elk out of its misery, 52-year-old Kenrick Workman drove to the scene where the two men were eagerly awaiting an opportunity to have themselves some roadkill. After arguing with the gentlemen who were patiently awaiting dinner, Workman pushed one of the men and retrieved a handgun from his car. He then threatened to shoot them.The men called police, who arrested Workman on existing warrants for a DUI, resisting arrest, and assault with a firearm.The NRA regularly assures us that gun owners are exactly the people who will save us from oblivion. While they draw a distinction between  good guys  and  bad guys with guns,  the problem is that in the eyes of the NRA everyone is a  good guy with a gun  until they commit a crime. In other words, everyone should be trusted with a weapon until it is too late   even someone who would rush out of his home to threaten people in a bizarre argument over who gets to eat the animal someone left on the side of the road.It is unclear if anyone got to eat the elk.Featured image via ",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

"This week, Donald Trump joined a collection of scientists, engineers, and astronauts to sign an executive order renewing the National Space Council. It was not exactly a meeting of the minds.Trump had a prepared speech but at several points veered wildly off script, leaving the people standing around him   including renowned former astronaut and national hero Buzz Aldrin   to squirm, grimace, and cringe at the sheer stupidity of what was coming out of his mouth. Even worse, on the very same day Trump was holding the photo op, the last three members of the White House science office (all holdovers from the Obama administration) left the job. Trump hasn t bothered to staff the office with anyone else. Science is not exactly a priority of his.The awkward affair was caught by television cameras meant to record the event and Aldrin s pained expression quickly went viral.Buzz Aldrin thinking he would much rather live on the Moon right now pic.twitter.com/wXVfCgt6cT  Paul Szoldra (@PaulSzoldra) July 1, 2017At the time, Trump was rambling about  space    a concept he apparently did not fully understand. And security is going to be a very big factor with respect to space and space exploration.  At some point in the future, we re going to look back and say how did we do it without space? Those are words, sure, but what is he trying to say? Nobody in the room seemed to know.Making matters worse, near the end of the signing, Aldrin cracked a joke that went so far over Trump s head it could have landed on the moon.

The reference to Toy Story s resident space ranger was missed on Trump who came out with this incredible word salad about the concept of  infinity. This is infinity here.  It could be infinity.  We don t really don t know.  But it could be.  It has to be something   but it could be infinity, right?

"Most of us are fully aware that Republican nominee Donald Trump is not only a racist, a misogynist and a bigot, but a complete psychopath and compulsive liar. But what happens when Trump is actually put through a clinical sanity test? Political commentator Keith Olbermann decided to find out.In a courageous attempt to understand the way Trump s disturbed mind works, Olbermann examined Trump using clinical psychology practices, which lead to his conclusion that Trump would not pass any of the  sanity  tests commonly used to identify criminal and antisocial tendencies.Olbermann released his findings on Thursday in Vanity Fair, and the results were not good for the future of America. The particular test Olbermann chose to evaluate Trump was  The Hare Psychopathy Checklist , developed by Canadian criminal psychologist Robert D. Hare, which serves as a kind of triage device to separate the injured from the tripping from the psychopathic. This particular test goes through 20 different personality traits, awarding points for each. Such traits include a grandiose sense of self-worth, pathological lying, lack of empathy, parasitic lifestyle, promiscuous sexual behavior, and a failure to accept responsibility for one s own actions. Just by that small sample of traits alone, you can probably already guess how Trump might have scored.The maximum amount of points you can get is 40, and clinical psychopathy is considered any score 30 or above. Trump scored a whopping 32   making him a certainty for a diagnosis of clinical psychopathy. Olbermann remarked on Trump s mental health: The implications are clear. Our Trumperor s New Clothes media rightly sees the latest Trump  event whatever it is this time as one of the most unbelievable developments in American political history. But the simple mechanics of following, reporting, and writing the proverbial  new high in low  every single day means that they could be missing one overriding truth about the health of the most remarkable presidential candidate since at least 1864. In short, our amateurs  exercise with the very professional Hare Psychopathy Checklist suggests that if you were betting on it, you d probably want to bet that Donald Trump couldn t pass a sanity test open book. If that isn t terrifying, I don t know what is. Trump is the GOP nominee, and although Clinton will probably wipe the floor with him in the election, the fact that someone as hateful and mentally unstable as Trump has gotten this close to the White House should worry us all.Here s a video from Olbermann, which goes through the test and Trump s results:Featured image via screenshot",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Donald Trump has not even taken office yet and he has already pissed off the most populous nation on the planet.For nearly 40 years, the United States and made it policy that the American president does not contact the leader of Taiwan for the sake of stable relations with China.But Donald Trump violated that policy on Friday by talking to Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen.China does not recognize Taiwan as an independent nation and considers the island its territory. This goes all the way back to 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek evacuated his Nationalist forces to Taiwan after being defeated by Communist forces in the Chinese Civil War.China has refused to recognize Taiwan ever since and considers it a renegade territory.Trump claims that the phone call was merely congratulatory and that both sides expressed that  close economic, political and security ties exist between Taiwan and the United States. But if you believe that, I have a golden tower to sell you. Most likely, Trump is getting cozy with Taiwan because his company wants to build luxury hotels and resorts on the island, which is yet another conflict of interest Trump has refused to deal with and is more proof that Trump only wants to use the presidency for his own selfish financial gain.Trump s action has been criticized by diplomats and state department personnel. And his recklessness has now drawn an angry response from the Chinese government.In a statement, the Chinese foreign ministry lodged a formal protest and warned Trump to beware of risking relations between our two nations again.  It must be pointed out that there is only one China in the world,  Chinese officials said.  We urge the relevant side in the US to adhere to the  one China  policy, abide by the pledges in the three joint China-US communiques, and handle issues related to Taiwan carefully and properly to avoid causing unnecessary interference to the overall China-U.S. relationship. Again, Trump has not even taken office yet and he is already screwing up decades worth of established foreign policy, proving once again that he is too irresponsible to be president.China is a major holder of U.S. foreign debt and is a major manufacturer of products sold by American businesses. So pissing the Chinese off could not only lead to a war, it could substantially cripple our economy.Donald Trump serious needs to read the relevant intelligence and foreign policy briefings so he doesn t do anything stupid like this again.Featured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

"For a long time now, the mainstream media has avoided questioning Donald Trump about the questionable relationship between a donation he made to the Attorney General in Florida and her decision to give his allegedly fraudulent Trump University a pass. After progressives complained about the issue on social media, the press has finally begun asking Trump about the details of his gift to Pam Bondi, which was recently flagged as a violation of the law by the IRS, resulting in a fine.Asked about the cash gift and the later favor delivered by Bondi, Trump immediately got caught in an inconvenient lie. I never spoke to her, first of all. She s a fine person, beyond reproach. I never even spoke to her about it at all. She s a fine person. Never spoken to her about it, never,  Trump said Monday while campaigning in Ohio.  Many of the attorney generals turned that case down because I ll win that case in court. Many turned that down. I never spoke to her. Marc Reichelderfer   who worked as a consultant on Bondi s reelection effort   told the Associated Press in June that Bondi spoke with Trump and solicited the donation herself. Reichelderfer said that Bondi had not been aware of the complaints against Trump University when she asked for the contribution.Trump doesn t have to have spoken with Bondi about his donation to her for it to be clear evidence of a  pay for play  scandal, but it is telling that as usual his first, off the cuff remark about Bondi turns out to have been false.Trump also made a donation to the attorney general in Texas, who then dropped a probe of Trump University, and it is unknown how many other government officials got nice checks from Trump before they made decisions about his business interests.But we do know that his first instinct was to tell an easily provable lie.Featured image via YouTube",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

He is also the most outrageously dangerous major party presidential candidate that America has seen in recent memory   perhaps ever. Well, many people on both the left and the right know this, and have jumped on the #NeverTrump train. Now, there is a very interesting development: a group of women who have been lifelong Republicans doing all they can to elect presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton.The group is calling itself  Republican Women for Hillary,  and spent their 4th of July evening holding the first meeting of their fledgling organization at Washington s St. Regis Hotel. These women are definitely not your typical Hillary supporters. One of them admittedly spent copious amounts of time campaigning against abortion rights, and another is a Southern Baptist who is basically against everything Hillary Clinton and Democrats in general stand for. However, their mission is to make sure Donald Trump never gets anywhere near the Oval Office   even if it means doing all they can to elect Hillary Clinton.U.S. Chamber of Commerce employee and staunch Republican Jennifer Lim, who helped found the group, explains the logic: It s really important that Republican leaders, especially Republican women leaders, stand up right now and say we re not OK with Trump representing our party. This is not a position I ever wanted to find myself in. But it s important that when things like this happen that people speak up. It is important to note that this group is in no way affiliated with the Clinton campaign, but they do intend to do their own campaigning and activist activities, including urging people to vote for Clinton, while also helping conservatives facing political backlash for condemning Donald Trump and his destructive, dangerous campaign.Here is the tweet from the group s twitter, endorsing Clinton:We're with her! #GOPwithHer #ImWithHer https://t.co/FhKIaa6BX5  RWFH (@GOPWomenWithHer) June 7, 2016Meghan Milloy, who is a member of Republican Woman for Hillary but also works for a conservative think tank called American Action Forum, seems conflicted and it is clear the decision was not easy to join this group. However, her resolve is solid. She says:  It has been tough for me to come to this point where I can vote for a candidate who has been very against what I ve been working for for most of my professional career. That being said, I can t vote for someone like Donald Trump because he s overtly racist and misogynist. Jennifer Lim goes on to clarify the group s position: Are you a Republican who thinks @realDonaldTrump should not become president?Tell us why: https://t.co/OvwepPNXoC  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 6, 2016Featured image via David McNew/Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"It s been more than a week since the election of Donald Trump and his supporters have been teaching us a big lesson   namely that they re really bad winners and that their sense of entitlement to nearly everything just escalated because their orange candidate won a few more swing states.At a Starbucks near the University of Miami, a man who thought his coffee was taking just a little too long went on a racist rant that shows exactly the type of attitude of entitlement that Trump supporters are sporting now. Fortunately, it was all caught on video by another Starbucks customer, Jorge de C rdenas.The Starbucks was crowded, as many are at any given point during any given day. The white Trump (complete with Trump-like hair and a tall, leggy blonde companion who would surely win the approval of the President Elect) voter, though, thought he deserved to get his coffee faster than the others, and if he didn t, it had to be because Starbucks employees, some of whom happen to have dark skin, hate white people.The man was, by his standards, anyway, waiting too long in line, so he started screaming  Trump!  at an African-American employee. Then he claimed that there was  anti-white discrimination  and that s why he was waiting.He said it was  anti-white discrimination,'  C rdenas says,  so he started disparaging the staff. One patron called him an asshole, so he said,  Fuck you, bitch.  That s when I started filming. C rdenas whipped out his phone to take a video just as the man called the black employee  trash,  demanded his money back, and started shouting,  I voted for Trump! Trump! You lost, now give me my money back,  at the staff:Here s the video:#trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white  discrimination  pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy  jorge de c rdenas (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016If you think this is an isolated incident, just Google  Trump supporter and you will find dozens of examples of the so-called winners behaving very badly toward People of Color, toward LGBT people, toward Jewish people and toward Muslims.

"No matter which candidate you support, this moment on the campaign trail is pretty awesome. Trump has said he wants to support our veterans in a big way if elected. He showed he s a man of his word when he plucked a veteran from the crowd and hired her. Instead of his catchphrase  you re fired,  Mr. Trump told the previously homeless black woman,  You re hired. Just when you think the 2016 presidential race can t get more surreal, Donald Trump reprised his role from the hit realty TV show  The Apprentice  at Washington press conference Monday and plucked an unemployed veteran out of the audience for an impromptu job interview.It was yet another unexpected twist in Mr. Trump s unconventional run that has defied the pundits, confounded the GOP establishment and made him the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination.Mr. Trump summoned the Washington press corps to the under-construction Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, just blocks from the White House. He said the one way or another he s coming to the nation s capital.The billionaire businessman boasted that the hotel, which is being refurbished from the city s historic Old Post Office building, was being restored to the  highest level,  with luxurious suites and the largest ballroom in Washington.He said the hotel would open ahead of schedule and under budget in September.When hands went up from reporters gathered in the cavernous atrium where the hotel lobby was being built, Mr. Trump called on Alicia Watkins. HERE S THE ENCOUNTER BETWEEN TRUMP AND MS. WATKINS: Ms. Watkins, 38, a former Air Force staff sergeant who survived the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon and served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was at the press conference as a freelance writer working on an article about jobs for veterans.She briefly described her situation and complimented Mr. Trump s stance of expanding employment opportunities for veterans, and then asked if the hotel would be part of a jobs program. We are doing some of that. What are you looking for, what kind of position,  Mr. Trump asked, and then invited her to come to the podium.Pleased with her response, Mr. Trump directed her to one of his company s executives to work out a employment deal. If we can make a good deal on the salary, she s going to probably have this job,  said the real estate tycoon.Asked why he did the on-the-spot job interview, Mr. Trump said that he  felt good about her. It s a gut instinct,  he said.  I have instincts about people. Read more of this incredible story at: Washington Times ",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

"Rebel Media: Attacking someone for their politics could be expected from private citizens acting out against each other, but what about government and law enforcement officials?The Rebel has investigated the case of Mark Feigin, a California Trump supporter who was wrongfully accused of and charged with an anti-Muslim hate crime.On October 19, 2016, Feigin was arrested and charged with making a  criminal threat  and  annoying phone calls  against the Islamic Center of Southern California by the Los Angeles Police Department, and then by California Attorney General Kamala Harris.LAPD officers accused Feigin of making two threatening phone calls and claimed that they had traced the phone calls back to him, later labeling the calls a hate crime against Muslims.On October 19th, 2016, Feigin s home was raided by the LAPD and his weapons were confiscated and placed on display for the media during a press conference where the California Media and LAPD were complicit in portraying Feigin as a potential mass murderer.Cmdr. Horace Frank with the Los Angeles Police Department stated in a press conference in October 2016: The male caller threatened to kill the person who answered the phone along with other members of the center because of the caller s hatred for Muslims and his belief that Muslims will destroy the United States. The Rebel has obtained new documents and evidence through police disclosure surrounding the case which proves that the first phone call made to the Islamic Center came from the phone of a different California man, Michael Slawson.Michael Slawson is the son of Democratically appointed Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Slawson.In other words, Slawson s father is a judge in the same justice system under which Feigin was charged.",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Does anyone remember these girls?Dixie who?Just days before the release of the drug cartel thriller Sicario, actress Emily Blunt is taking more fire for saying during an interview last weekend she regrets becoming a U.S. citizen after watching the first Republican presidential debate.The star told The Hollywood Reporter,  I became an American citizen recently, and that night, we watched the Republican debate and I thought,  This was a terrible mistake. What have I done? During the interview, Blunt also described Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)15% as  pretty impressive. Tuesday, on Fox & Friends, co-host Anna Kooiman hit back hard at Blunt for those and other comments, saying,  You know what, then why don t you leave Hollywood, California, and let some American women take on the roles that you re getting? Because Americans are watching your movies and lining your pockets. Co-host Brian Kilmeade agreed, saying,  I agree with you. Longtime co-host Steve Doocy then compared Blunt s comments to those made by the country group the Dixie Chicks, who never rebounded after making critical, anti-war comments of President George W. Bush in 2003. You know what Emily Blunt just did? She just Dixie Chicked herself. She has alienated half the country, and now will think twice about going to one of her movies,  said Doocy. I actually didn t know she was, and I ve seen a lot of movies,  Kilmeade said.He added,  Congratulations You re an American citizen and you re very unhappy. https://youtu.be/h3DmvsASbaUBlunt doubled down on the comment Tuesday during a conversation with PEOPLE, when the mag asked her if filming the movie scared her.

Mexico s National Migration Institute has extended 12,500 permits to these African migrants that allow them to travel freely. Excelsior reports the amount of Africans entering Mexico is set to exceed the usual 800,000 Guatemalans, Salvadorans, and Hondurans who enter the country seeking to reach America s border.Mexico is not only being inundated with African migrants but also with Haitians. In the border town of Tijuana, 300 Haitians arrived on Sunday alone.There have been almost 10,000 foreigners in the border town of Tijuana in the past five months, and activists project this could reach 16,000. There has been violence due to this influx in foreigners and police have had to intervene. Maria del Rosario Lozada Romero, director of migrant care in the area, told Excelsior,  They themselves cause this disorder, they don t cooperate, and they hit women. More than 4,300 Haitians have entered the San Diego border crossing of San Ysidro between October 2015 and August 31, 2016, the San Diego Union Tribune reports. The Haitians along with the African migrants typically originate from Brazil where they were working or just took a boat to with the purpose of reaching the US. South American countries have liberal immigration policies allowing the migrants to reach Central America with ease.These immigrants either seek asylum in the United States or cross over illegally. Immigrants from Haiti along with Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, and South Sudan can live free of risk of deportation in the United States due to Obama administration policies.Read more: Daily Caller",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Donald Trump just got his ass handed to him by Nicolle Wallace for endorsing an accused child molester.Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore has been accused of sexual assault by several women, most of whom were teens at the time. One woman was 14-years-old.Age of consent laws apparently did not matter to Moore, who was the district attorney during the time period in which most of the assaults allegedly occurred. Moore own former colleagues have confirmed that Moore preyed upon teenage girls and he was even banned from a shopping mall because he kept creeping on teen girls.On Tuesday, Trump finally spoke out about Moore and the allegations. And what he said was sickening.Trump accused Moore s opponent Doug Jones of being  soft  on crime before saying he d rather have an accused child molester in the Senate instead of a Democrat. Then he defended Moore the same way he defended Vladimir Putin during his trip to Asia. Well, he denies it, Trump said.  Look, he denies it. I mean, if you look at all the things that have happened over the last 48 hours, he totally denies it. He says it didn t happen and you know, you have to listen to him also. Trump s words were so disgusting that MSNBC s Nicolle Wallace took him to the woodshed. I have this physical feeling of just being repulsed listening to   be it a figure head, he is the head of the Republican Party and I have described myself as a nonpracticing member, but I don t know what other word to use other than repulsed, that the head of the Republican Party said essentially threw his weight behind someone accused of stalking and engaging in sexual activity with a 14-year-old. There s nothing normal about throwing your weight behind a child molester. So when he says, this president says  he denies it, he denies it  I almost heard in him,  I denied it too.  He s almost projecting on to Roy Moore his own circumstance. Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, Trump was accused of sexual assault by over a dozen women during the campaign. He called all of them liars at the time. And it looks like that s coming back to bite Trump on the ass.Featured Image: Screenshot",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

"The worst thing is the number of white people and people with ties to law enforcement officers will pay to see one of the most influential, openly anti-white, anti-cop entertainers in America There are reportedly several Pittsburgh police officers refusing to work security for Beyonc s May 31 concert at Heinz Field, due to what they call the singer s anti-police lyrics in her latest Black Lives Matter-themed album,  Lemonade.  But city officials may force those officers to provide security for the show. There are police officers that have expressed that they do not want to support an artist that they don t like what she has to say,  said Robert Swartzwelder, president of the Fraternal Order of the Police Lodge No. 1.  It s up to them what they want to do with their off-duty time. Concert venues, like Heinz Field, usually ask city officials to provide off-duty police officers to work security or direct traffic at an event. The choice to work these events is usually each police officer s to make.However, a memorandum to officers from the City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police says the city may appoint between 29 to 35 officers to work at the concert if they don t recruit enough volunteers.Click HERE for Beyonc s racist, cop-hating video.Swartzwelder said the city s plan would be in direct breach of the contract agreement between the city of Pittsburgh and the police department. Such a move would force the Fraternal Order of the Police to file an unfair labor practice complaint on behalf of its member officers.Last February, the Miami Fraternal Order of Police announced a boycott of Beyonc s concert where her  Formation  world tour would be kicking off.

"This cop killer was a hateful, racist sub-human. He not only hated white people and cops, he bragged about it. The scary thing is, much like ISIS, who has no trouble recruiting people with hate in their hearts, there are no shortage of people to carry out Obama s war on cops in America. These are terrorists and our very own  President  has inspired these people to act on their hate for Whites, for cops and for America. This, is Obama s real legacy The 29 year old ex-marine, Gavin Eugene Long, who ambushed and killed three unsuspecting Baton Rouge police officers on Sunday morning, hated those who did not share his skin-tone and harbored a particular hatred for the police. As revealed in the hours after the shootings, a Youtube account operated by Long under the handle I Am Cosmo where the alleged killer posted dozens of clips, provides insight into what motivated the young man to kill three police officers and wound three more on his 29th birthday.In the Youtube videos, Long rants against  crackers, and makes multiple references to the July 5th killing of Alton Sterling at the hands of police officers only five miles away from Sunday s attack. The videos also detail that Long is a member of the Nation of Islam, labelled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center for its black supremacist and racist views towards Jews, Asians, and whites which the group s leaders argue have  sucked the blood from and exploited the black community.As Daily Caller details, the 29-year-old was a native of Kansas City, Missouri and was honorably discharged from the Marines in 2010 after reaching the rank of E-5. He preferred to go by the name Cosmo Ausar Setepenra rather than Gavin Eugene Long.In a video published on Thursday, the racist shooter says that  If I would have been there with Alton   Clap  before promoting a book that he wrote that discusses black liberation ideology.  I wrote it for my dark-skinned brothers,  said Long.  If you look at all the rebels like Black Panthers, Huey P. Newton, Malcolm X, and Elijah Muhammad, they was light-skinned. But we know how hard y all got it. https://youtu.be/kGuUq6eUoFwThe assailant also suggested that the black community should buy only from black-owned businesses rather than  working for the white people. In one video Long is heard lamented  working for the white people.  He encouraged one man riding in his vehicle as he filmed using a body camera to shop only at black-owned businesses. He brought up a hypothetical scenario in which a family member who wanted to buy carpet was forced to buy from non-black business owners saying    Who s she going to f  with?

Brian Sims woke up to find a message on his Facebook page which read,  N**ger faggot.  There wasn t much information on the troll s Facebook page. What caught me about it was there wasn t a reference to something I said or something I d done or some policy,  Sims told the Huffington Post.  And when I looked at his page there was very little there   but he d posted a telephone number a number of times. At 6:15 a.m. Sims decided to call the number and the woman who answered the phone turned out to be the troll s grandmother. You ve all seen the  Brave keyboard warrior sitting in Mom s basement eating a hot pocket sandwich  type meme but this was real life. I explained to her exactly who I as and what he had done,  Sims said.  Like any grandma she was very embarrassed at having this kind of convo and very ashamed at the actions of her grandson. The conversation ended with me telling her that I wanted to hear from him. Sims did speak to the troll but he said that the conversation  didn t resolve anything. It is the ultimate calling card of a coward to   under the guise of night and behind a keyboard   use the kind of language that in person would cause most decent people to respond in anger and frustration,  Sims said.

"Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick is known for making inflammatory comments after national tragedies in public. He is the guy who tweeted a picture with a bible verse that reads,  Do not be deceived. God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows,  right after the Orlando massacre.So, it shouldn t be too surprising that Patrick s post-Dallas shooting commentary is a giant pile of racist bullsh*t. Last Thursday during an interview on Fox News (of course), Patrick claimed that the protestors who were present at the protest during the shooting were  hypocrites  for running away while shots were being fired. All those protesters last night, they ran the other way, expecting the men and women in blue to turn around and protect them. What hypocrites. I understand the First Amendment. I understand freedom of speech, and I defend it. It is in our Constitution and is in our soul, but you can t go out on social media and mainstream media and everywhere else and say that the police are racist or police are hateful or the police are killers. Calling Black Lives Matter protesters hypocrites for running away when shots are being fired into a crowd   shots that hit both protestors and police   is just plain ugly. From all accounts, the protestors in Dallas and the local law enforcement were working together to make sure that the event was safe. Patrick went on to rant: I do blame people on social media, with their hatred towards police. I do blame, I saw Jesse Jackson   I think it was on Fox the other night   calling police racist without any facts. I do blame former Black Lives Matters protests. Last night was peaceful, but others have not been,  Patrick went on to say.Yeah seriously, Patrick said that. Black Lives Matter is to blame for the actions of one individual who had no previous role in the movement.As far as Patrick s insistence on shutting up about the wholesale slaughter of black lives on social media goes   it s never going to happen.

"It s funny how Trump kept screaming that the election was rigged all through his campaign, and now screams there s massive voter fraud everywhere considering that the three states that gave him the White House are getting ready to recount their votes. Lawyers for Trump are mobilizing to block recounts in Michigan and Pennsylvania in a panic, trying to stop these efforts. Wisconsin s recount is already underway, so good luck there.Michigan s recount is set to begin today, yet Trump believes that any recount in that state would be  lawless,  despite the fact that recounting election votes is as American as hot dogs with ketchup at the ballpark. His complaint could stall that recount until it becomes impossible to do it, and that s probably his goal. The Board of Canvassers is scheduled to discuss Trump s specious claims today.In Pennsylvania, Trump s attorneys accused Jill Stein of  commandeering Pennsylvania s electoral process, with an eye toward doing the same to the Electoral College.  They go on to say that there s no evidence of fraud or tampering, and imply that the recount shouldn t happen because of this. Indeed, one judge has blocked recount efforts in one part of the state, but it s not clear what the state itself will do.What are they so afraid of? Seriously. Trump himself alleged massive voter fraud, and his minions have glommed on to that absurd narrative, but they won. They won the White House, so what s the problem here? If anything, they ought to be celebrating these recounts because they should believe such recounts will just reinforce the legitimacy of Trump s win.Is it the anomalies in Wisconsin that s scaring the living demons out of him? Perhaps it s his shrinking margin in Pennsylvania that s got him terrified. Following Philadelphia s final tally, Trump s lead shrank from roughly 71,000 to 46,435 votes. That could be scary. Or maybe it s the fact that Michigan agreed to a recount despite the fact that the state only uses paper ballots.Hillary is now down by less than 80,000 votes across all three battleground states.The problems in all three states could be enough to worry him. If he were any kind of classy, though, he d tell them to go ahead with their recounts, and he d have his people tell the press and anyone else who will listen that he s confident these recounts won t reveal anything new.That should be obvious. But what s truly obvious is that Trump is scared that the recounts will show he lost. Whether they actually will or not remains to be seen, but he and his officials are making complete fools of themselves by contesting the recounts like this.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

"There have been a lot of strange things to happen over the course of this election cycle, but what you re about to witness may be in the top ten, maybe even the top three.As much as it s nice to see one time foes Donald Trump and Ben Carson getting along so splendidly, albeit likely for illegal reasons, this new bromance took a turn for the awkward while at a fundraising event in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, when the two were seen dancing together while being serenaded.While the singer sang what could easily be the whitest version of Ben E. King s  Stand By Me  ever sung, Trump and Carson casually swayed back and forth to the easy listening tune in front of a crowd of eager donors who can t wait for Trump to turn all of America into a casino and/or golf resort.Of course, the singer would swap in words like  Donald Trump, stand by me    and while I know this may make most sane people vomit, or likely laugh at the idea of Trump actually caring about anyone other than himself, Trump did seem to like it.There s really no other way to describe what happened, so please check it out for yourselves.Watch the video here via Washington Post: Featured image via video screen capture",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Now that Indiana governor Mike Pence has officially been announced as Donald Trump s running mate, it s important to understand exactly who he is and what his stances on key issues are. Those who were expecting Trump to select a more moderate VP pick are going to learn really fast that Pence is anything but moderate.During a segment on MSNBC s AM Joy, an expert on Christian fundamentalism made it very clear that Pence is a dangerous right-wing radical, especially concerning his views on women s healthcare rights.The show s host, Joy Reid asked Sharlet what his thoughts on Pence are concerning the  nexus between evangelicalism and Republicanism in Washington. Sharlet answers, calling Pence a  broker  between the two. To understand Mike Pence and to understand that kind of religious conservative politics, you have to not think of social conservatism and fiscal conservatism as separate, but like Mike Pence say,  Our goal, our mission, is to marry fiscal and moral values.  He sees them as one in the same, so when you go back in his record and you look at his speeches about abortion, which are really something, Sharlet answered.  He is probably the most anti-abortion presidential or VP candidate we ve had. You see him also bringing in financial. He sees it if we don t stop abortion, our economy will collapse. So he s the guy who sort of stands in the middle between those two factions of the Republican Party. At that point, Reid brings up Pence s record regarding abortion, Planned Parenthood, and his failures as a leader during a recent HIV outbreak, saying: On abortion, he signed a law as Indiana governor banning abortions because of genetic anomalies, abortions that were unfortunate anomalies, and he also signed a law mandating, and this is weird, women who have a miscarriage or an abortion had to have a burial for the fetus and must cremate after a miscarriage or abortion. On LGBT rights, he signed a law allowing religious beliefs as a defense against discrimination in lawsuits, and then after a backlash, he s revised the law to exclude LGBT discrimination which got him in trouble with conservatives in Indiana. On prison, he reinstated a ten-year mandatory minimum drug sentencing,  said Reid.That s only a small sampling of what Sharlet and Reid had to say about Pence s record. It s very clear that the GOP has no interest in supporting even a faux-moderate candidate this election judging by the support he is receiving.The bottom line is that Pence is too dangerous to allow into office.

".During the days of the Old West shooting an an unarmed man violated a code that cowboys lived by and brought shame as well as arrest and prosecution for murder.But in the conservative version of the Old West we are being forced to live in today, codes and the law mean nothing as long as you re a Christian gun nut.During the morning church service on Sunday at Keystone Fellowship Church located within Montgomery County in Pennsylvania a parishioner with a concealed carry permit shot and killed 27-year-old Robert Braxton in the chest during some sort of altercation as members of the congregation ducked for cover after the shots rang out. It sounded like three pops, almost like a champagne bottle opening three times,  said congregant Breeana Somers.  Everybody s trying to make themselves as small as possible. You could hear some screaming and some crying but it was pretty silent. I went under a chair in a fetal position. I tried to make myself as small as possible. It s really frightening that anything like this could happen here. Despite the fact that the gun-toting churchgoer openly murdered an unarmed man for what is sure to be a ridiculous reason, the man has not been arrested or charged, according to Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele. There s no one in custody,  he told NBC 10.  The individual involved in the shooting is cooperating with police at this point. Yeah, and he s the only one who gets to tell the story because the other guy is dead.Ironically, the Keystone Church had written a Facebook post earlier announcing that an anti-government evangelical pastor would be a guest speaker that day and banned photography and video  for our guest s safety.  Apparently, church leadership was not concerned about guns or the threat they pose to the safety of their congregation.Here s the video via NBC 10.Again, a man literally shot and killed an unarmed man in the middle of a church service and he gets to walk free.

"The trend of young Muslim men targeting and attacking white non-Muslims continues world wide. A group of three Muslim men attacked strangers at the Liverpool city center because they were white  non-Muslims.  One witness feared the men were ISIS terrorists because they were using  racist language, talking about Muslims and Christians. A very similar occurrence took place in one of Minneapolis  more upscale neighborhoods last year when a mob of up to 30 young Somali men marched through the streets yelling disparaging comments and threatening homeowners:Somalis living in Minneapolis are almost all Sunni Muslims. Residents of the Lake Calhoun area say this wasn t the first time a group of Somali men have made an intimidating march through their neighborhood, which is filled with million-dollar homes.They first approached victim Gary Bohanna inquiring what religion he was affiliated with. When Bohanna answered I m a Christian,  the attacker shouted  Why aren t you a Muslim?  before punching him twice. The three men then approached Paul Lynch, Labour councillor for Moss Bank, and his girlfriend. One of the men punched Mr. Lynch with a  sickening blow  that could be  seen and heard.  He did not utter any racist comments, but the attackers laughed as the victim fell. Both men were taken to the hospital for their injuries.Witness Edris Nosrati called police but one of the men tried to flee, so the witness chased and caught him. The teenager struck Mr. Nosrati, but the hero held on. When questioned by police, one of the men claimed he was too intoxicated to remember anything. Another denied the assaults and suggested they had been racially abused by other men. However, he later confessed to  targeting people because they were white and non-Muslim. The Counter Terrorism Unit became involved in the investigation and the mens  family homes were turned upside down by the police. Amin Mohmed cried in court as he was jailed for 42 weeks. Mohammed and Faruq Patel received 42 and 18 weeks respectively in a young offenders institution.Read more: The Echo ",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"A progressive group charged Saturday that the Democratic National Committee s reliance on paper ballots in the race for DNC chair raises questions of transparency, tainting the process.The DNC had planned on using both an electronic system, as well as paper ballots, but switched gears minutes before the vote when interim Chair Donna Brazille announced they would rely on the ballots in part because of concerns over spotty internet service.Now there s a party member you can trust the former interim chair Donna Brazille, who secretly passed CNN s debate questions to Hillary Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Committee, pointed to reports that said some DNC members are concerned over blowback they could receive from the Bernie Sanders-aligned forces that are supporting Rep. Keith Ellison if their support for former Labor Secretary Tom Perez became public. Paper ballots instead of visible and accountable voting is something that Debbie Wasserman Shultz would be proud of,  Mr. Green said on Twitter, alluding to the former chair, who resigned after hacked emails showed DNC members were biased against Mr. Sanders in the 2016 primary race.The group also highlighted a DNC rule that said  secret ballots are not permitted  and the results should be shared with the candidate or their campaign in the case that the contest goes beyond the first ballot.

"The Trump campaign and the conservative media have been having a field day with Hillary s health. The idea that she s in really bad health is an absolutely asinine theory that s gotten to the point where some are circulating fake medical documents, while others, like Martin  Pharma Bro  Shkreli (who isn t anything like a doctor) are diagnosing her with things like Parkinson s.During a very recent stump speech, she stopped to cough. Knowing that conservatives were going to pounce on her again for that, she said: Every time I think about Trump I get allergic. She s allergic to Donald Trump! (Aren t we all?) This made the audience roar, and it s made others laugh, too. It s not difficult to be allergic to Trump   his speeches are really nothing more than giant fountains of toxic waste.

"Now it beings the government has changed who is a refugee to include climate refugees. Does anyone else see the insanity in this? This could mean just about anyone who simply claims they fear climate change has harmed their very existence. Watch out for this one to be used by anyone and everyone. OF COURSE THE UNITED NATIONS IS BEHIND THIS REDISTRIBUTION SCAM ALONG WITH JOHN KERRY:The United Nations Institute for Environment and Human Security and the International Organization for Migration estimated that climate change could displace as many as 200 million individuals by 2050. Most of these would likely be fisherfolk and farmers relying on the environment for their livelihood.SLICK SCAM: John Kerry Warns Global Warming Will Produce Millions Of  Climate Refugees Climate change, particularly unprecedented sea level rise, is already creating refugees in the United States.Back in January, the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that it will allocate $1 billion in grants to 13 states to help them adapt to climate change. The projects will include building stronger dams as well as drainage systems. Among those grants was $48 million for Isle de Jean Charles, the first time federal tax dollars were reserved for moving an entire community mired with the impacts of climate change. The low-lying island on the Gulf coast of Louisiana is already sinking. The island is home to a few dozen people whose way of life is rooted from generations back. They are now getting displaced and turned into climate refugees.  We re going to lose all our heritage, all our culture. It s all going to be history,  mourned Chief Albert Naquin of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw, the tribe where most of the island s residents belong, in a New York Times report. From once being 22,000 acres in size, the island has now been reduced to only 320 acres. According to 2009 data reported by Northern Arizona University, only 25 houses remained occupied, down from 63 only five years earlier.In a release, Louisiana Office of Community Development executive director Pat Forbes said that the tribe is frontlining the disaster of Louisiana s coastal land loss. The grant, she added, will help them resettle to a safer location and serve as a model for resettlement of endangered U.S. communities. Since the 1950s, the Native American tribe has already lost some 98 percent of its land to climbing sea levels, flooding and coastal erosion, with the island suspected to be totally submerged in a matter of 50 years. Naquin expressed excitement in an Indian Country Today interview over their  chance to reunite the family  and keep the culture intact. According to reports, the tribe will remain owners of the island even after relocating to its new community, something that could take place as soon as 2019. The first-of-its-kind grant must be spent by 2022. Read more: Tech Times",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

"Ami Horowitz is a thought provoking filmmaker who took a lot of heat for exposing the truth about the horrific, violent  no-go zones  in Sweden in one of his recent documentary films. Horowitz is also very controversial because he doesn t shy away from asking tough questions of the people he randomly interviews on the streets.In fiscal year 2014, Minnesota took in 2,232 refugees, according to the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement. Almost half of those were from Somalia.In the video below, Ami took to the streets in the Cedar Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis, MN to talk a variety of Somali Muslim immigrants. Ami posed several questions to a large variety of random Somali Muslim immigrants. He asked young boys, teenagers, middle-aged men and even an older woman their thoughts on how they felt about living in the United States, and if they d rather living back in Somalia. Horowitz also asked if they would prefer to live under Sharia Law or American laws. Their answers may surprise you.The most shocking part of the video however, comes near the end when Horowitz begins to discuss freedom of speech in America. While one of the men being interviewed talks about how great it is to be in America and to be afforded rights like freedom of speech and freedom of religion, every single Muslim respondent believed that free speech is great unless it involves criticizing the prophet Mohammed. Horowitz took his question a step further and asked if was okay for Muslims to use violence against someone who disparaged or insulted Mohammed. Every Muslim he asked, believed that using violence, including killing a person who criticized or mocked Mohammed, would be justified.Watch:After a major dip in 2008, the year ly num bers of new So ma li refu gees in Minnesota have re bounded stead i ly.

"After the Orlando Massacre we ve once again seen Republicans   led by Donald Trump   blame all Muslims for the action of one person or group of people. They insist, while not citing any actual evidence, that Muslims in America are not helping law enforcement to prevent terrorists in their midst, who are operating in their communities.It isn t true, and now someone is speaking out. Mohammed A. Malik actually flagged Orlando shooter Omar Mateen to the FBI, and after hearing Trump slander him and fellow Muslims, he s had enough.In an essay for the Washington Post, Malik told his story first hand:Donald Trump believes American Muslims are hiding something.  They know what s going on. They know that [Omar Mateen] was bad,  he said after the Orlando massacre.  They have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad.   But you know what? They didn t turn them in. And you know what? We had death and destruction. This is a common idea in the United States. It s also a lie. First, Muslims like me can t see into the hearts of other worshipers. (Do you know the hidden depths of everyone in your community?) Second, Trump is wrong that we don t speak up when we re able.Malik goes on to explain that after learning that Mateen had been watching videos put out by terrorist propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki,  I contacted the FBI again to let them know that Omar had been watching Awlaki s tapes. He hadn t committed any acts of violence and wasn t planning any, as far as I knew. And I thought he probably wouldn t, because he didn t fit the profile: He already had a second wife and a son. But it was something agents should keep their eyes on. Why did he do this?I had told the FBI about Omar because my community, and Muslims generally, have nothing to hide. I love this country, like most Muslims that I know. I don t agree with every government policy (I think there s too much money in politics, for instance), but I m proud to be an American.He concludes with a direct message for the Republican nominee for President of the United States:  Trump s assertions about our community   that we have the ability to help our country but have simply declined to do so   are tragic, ugly and wrong.

"It s starting to get old but Trump was right again   Iranian state-run media in Tehran did indeed videotape the arrival of a January 17 flight carrying $400 million in cash from the United States   and the money itself   judging from a documentary that aired the following month in the Islamic republic. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has been in a firestorm of controversy since first claiming on Wednesday to have seen  secret  footage of money being offloaded from an aircraft.He admitted Friday morning on Twitter what his campaign had said more than a day earlier, that he had seen ordinary archival footage of a different plane, carrying American hostages freed from Iran arriving in Geneva Switzerland after the money changed hands. But it turns out he may have been right without knowing it.The Iranian video was aired February 15 on the state-run Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting television network, as part of a documentary called  Rules of the Game.  A narrator, speaking in Persian, describes a money-for-hostages transaction over video clips of a plane on an airport tarmac in the dead of night and a photo of a giant shipping pallet stacked with what appear to be banknotes.The federal government shipped what many are calling a ransom payment in Euros and other non-U.S. currencies.The copy of the documentary footage DailyMail.com obtained is not of high enough quality to determine which nation s banknotes are depicted.None of the footage is stamped with a date or time, making it impossible to know when it was shot.And the broadcaster blurred out one portion of the screen, covering up something resting on top of the mountain of money.But the documentary begins with a narration saying:  In the early morning hours of January 17, 2016 at Mehrabad Airport, $400 million in cash was transported to Iran on an airplane. The film describes the Obama administration s prisoner swap and Iran s cash windfall from Tehran s point of view as  a win-lose deal that benefits the Islamic Republic of Iran and hurts the United States,  according to two English-language translations DailyMail.com obtained.

It was already assumed that this debate wouldn t have nearly the spirit of the presidential debates, but The Onion took it nine steps further with this  quote  from the moderator, Elaine Quijano: It s crucial that you stay in a single-file line and make sure to keep moving in an orderly fashion so the aisles are clear for others attempting to leave their seats. And please abstain from slamming the door so as not to disturb those audience members who are sleeping.  [emphasis mine] The Daily Show s  live feed included a picture of a glass of milk with a tie, and some toast with a tie:The allusion is to milquetoast, which refers to a 1920s comic book character, Caspar Milquetoast, who was timid, and now is a general reference to people who are meek or timid. Accompanying that image was audio from the actual debate.

It looked as if it couldn t possibly get any worse than Trump throwing a temper tantrum about the media instead of inspiring the graduating students   but that wasn t the only insanity that occurred.Apparently, Department of Homeland Security secretary John Kelly had no idea he was being recorded, because he got caught on a hot mic making a disgusting joke to Trump, and of course, Trump was laughing right along in agreement with him.During the ceremony, Trump was presented with a saber   another instrument that should never be placed in the hands of a man baby.

"If you haven t noticed by now that Donald Trump rallies have become white pride events then you are either willfully ignorant, or living under a rock. In fact, some of Trump s most fervent supporters are members of white supremacist groups, including former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke. It s gotten to the point where shouting  Trump Trump Trump  is synonymous with shouting  white pride.  And if you disagree with that sentiment, take a good long look at yourself in the mirror and think about why you disagree.Noticing how racist Trump supporters are, along with the rest of the sane world, is none other than the folks over at Saturday Night Live. They put together the perfect spoof campaign ad to attack these nincompoops head-on. In a sketch titled,  Racists for Trump  they start by showing what seems to be average Americans working hard and simply loving what Trump stands for. The commercial begins: The media s been saying some pretty negative things about Donald Trump, but what are real Americans saying? Trump was then labeled a  winner,   authentic,  job creator, negotiator,  an  outsider,  and above all else, the candidate who can  Make America Great Again. It s at that point when it s revealed that all the supporters speaking are involved some way or another in a white supremacist organization. Whether it be neo-Nazis, the KKK, or simply  white pride,  SNL does not hold back in slamming the hate and bigotry that s been spewing out of the Trump campaign alongside his supporters.But of course, all that hate is disguised in clever coded language to make it seem like we don t notice, but guess what? We notice.Bravo to SNL, this is absolutely perfect. Well done.Featured image via image screen capture",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

"If Donald Trump picked retired General David Petraeus as the next Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense, it would be his worst hypocrisy to date.For months, Trump attacked Hillary Clinton relentlessly for keeping a private email server as Secretary of States, accusing her of exposing classified information even though the FBI cleared her of any such wrongdoing.You know who the FBI didn t clear of such wrongdoing? David Petraeus.And that s why Trump would be a hypocrite if he actually offered him either significant government posts. But he is doing exactly that.Back in 2012, Petraeus infamously resigned as Director of the CIA after it was revealed that he had been engaged in an affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell, whom he gave access to eight  Black Books  filled with highly classified information, which included  the identities of covert officers, war strategy, intelligence capabilities and mechanisms, diplomatic discussions,  and discussions he had with President Obama.It was such a terrible breach in national security that the Justice Department wanted to prosecute him for committing a felony, and would have if Petraeus had not agreed to a plea deal in 2015.So while Hillary Clinton was doing nothing different from what other Secretaries of State have done, it s pretty clear that what Petraeus did makes him the real threat to national security.And it s unclear if he could even get the security clearance necessary for a Secretary of State or Defense to have in order to do the job. After all, Trump said of Clinton in September that,  If she applied for a low-level job at the State Department today she couldn t even get a security clearance. Obviously, Trump could always pull strings and we already know that Republicans in Congress are hypocrites who can be easily bought. But picking Petraeus for either one of these top jobs would demonstrate that he is a hypocrite who doesn t give a damn about national security and that he has a double standard.By picking Petraeus, Trump would also be admitting once again that he lied to his supporters. Trump has been stringing them along for months getting them to chant  Lock her up  every time he calls Hillary Clinton a criminal. But if anybody should be locked up, it s Petraeus. He literally shared highly classified information that could have put people and the country at risk. But Trump is considering him anyway and that is infuriating.Featured Image: Wikimedia",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

"Last night, Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic presidential nomination in Philadelphia and gave a powerful speech that was the perfect celebratory end to the Democratic National Convention. Her speech portrayed her accurately as a candidate far more qualified to lead America than Donald Trump, and broke down the barriers with not only Bernie Sanders supporters, but Republican voters as well.Clinton s acceptance speech was a massive success for those reasons alone, but something even more surreal was taking place  we all witnessed an historic moment as Clinton had shattered America s highest glass ceiling by becoming the first woman to be nominated by a major party. And the sad thing was, that while Clinton set new ground for women in America, all conservatives could do was complain about her voice and appearance.Apparently, nothing brings out blatant GOP sexism like a strong, intelligent, accomplished woman achieving something monumental. Instead of recognizing that history was literally being made before our very eyes, conservatives made sure to take Clinton down a notch by insulting her on the most minor things. One of the first sexism offenses came from Brit Hume on Fox News, who reduced Clinton to her voice and mouth when he said: She has a habit, when speaking, of breaking into a kind of a sharp, lecturing tone, makes you feel like. She has a great asset, as a public person, which is a radiant smile, but she has a not so attractive voice.

"The White House led people to believe that a U.S. aircraft carrier was on his way to the waters off the Korean peninsula in a show of military strength. White House press secretary said,  I think when you see a carrier group steaming into an area like that, the forward presence of that is clearly, through almost every instance, a huge deterrence,  he said, adding that it  gives the President options in the region.  However, none of that is true because the U.S. aircraft carrier was traveling in the opposite direction.According to vice-president Mike Pence, the claims of the location of the U.S. aircraft carrier supposedly on its way off the Korean peninsula were not made intentionally. Or in reality, he s saying the White House doesn t know how to communicate because it s so inept, or perhaps, Trump used this to bolster his alleged presidency so that his first 100 days in office won t appear to be a complete disaster.Politico reports:Earlier this month, White House and Pentagon officials announced that the USS Carl Vinson and its accompanying battle group had been deployed off the coast of the Korean peninsula, a response to a missile test launched by North Korea. But on Monday, Defense News reported that the Carl Vinson was nowhere near the Korean peninsula and had instead been photographed near Indonesia.After reports from major outlets saying that the Carl Vinson had not immediately turned north towards the Korean peninsula, government officials were left having to explain why the aircraft carrier had not been deployed as initially described.Pence was asked during an interview with CNN if the remarks from White House and Pentagon officials had been intentional and the vice-president said,  oh, I think not  then went on to say there was already a strong U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific region, including in Japan and South Korea. Pence did not explain why government officials declared that the that the strike group was  steaming up toward the sea of Japan. Here is Sean Spicer saying exactly that on Monday:CNN interviewed Pence aboard the USS Ronald Reagan at the U.S. Yokosuka naval base in Tokyo Bay and addressed the crew saying that the U.S. would  work diligently  with allies to maintain and increase pressure on North Korea. The United States of America will always seek peace but under President Trump, the shield stands guard and the sword stands ready,  Pence said.  Those who would challenge our resolve or readiness should know, we will defeat any attack and meet any use of conventional or nuclear weapons with an overwhelming and effective American response. The word  effective  doesn t mean what Pence thinks it means.Just one week after the announcement that the carrier was off the Korean peninsula, an official Navy photo showed that the strike group was actually farther away from the claimed location than it had been at the time of the announcement.Photo by Aaron P.

"Post election, the media and Donald Trump voters everywhere have been rewriting recent history. They are making the claim that Trump wasn t elected because of racism; he was elected because of the economy. The problem with that argument, though, is that it s simply not true. Trump voters are racist and there s proof.The American National Elections Study (ANES) began the study in January. Initially, they asked  How likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead.  Now, of course, anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that. It s VERY unlikely that whites aren t getting jobs because minorities are, but that s not what Trump voters think. The vast majority said that it s  extremely likely  that minorities are taking jobs from white people.Graph courtesy of ANES and Salon.Then, they asked the same Trump voters about a non-racial issue, trade. Despite the fact that trade was one of Trump s signature issues, their opinions on trade were mixed.Post election, this is what the study found:The question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for Trump over Clinton. Eighty-four percent of whites who believe it is  extremely likely  that whites can t find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support Trump, compared with 23 percent of those who think it is  not at all  likely. Among white Democrats, 58 percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support Trump over Clinton, compared with less than 1 percent of those who believe it is not at all likely. Eighty-one percent of white women who think it is  extremely likely  people of color are taking jobs supported Trump, compared with 26 percent who don t think that.More than that, 78 percent of white Trump supporters say black people are  violent.  84 percent think that of Muslims.Unfortunately, Democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism, hoping that eventually, the aging bigots will die off. It turns out their children are just as bad. Sean McElwee, the man who was responsible for publishing the study, suggested this:Democrats must create a narrative that weaves economic, racial and gender justice together. A multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic, racial and gender inequality. As I ve shown with political scientist Jason McDaniel, racism often diminishes support for progressive policies. The solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising American electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation.Great idea, if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigots  claims go unchallenged.Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"While much of the focus of the election year so far has been on Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, understandably, there has been a major change with regards to one of the key political figures in America and it has the potential to be a huge factor on the election.Since January of this year, President Obama s approval rating has seen a double digit increase. He is 12% higher now than he was then.But over the course of the year, Obama s approval numbers changed   quickly, and a lot. In Gallup s most recent weekly average, Obama is at 51-45   the exact opposite of where he was on Jan. 1 and a 12-point swing since then. He s been at 50 percent or higher in every week since March 1, save one.[ ]Looking at quarterly averages of Obama s approval, you can see how stark the improvement has been by party. Democrats have slowly looked at Obama more favorably since the beginning of 2015, but independents have begun to look at Obama much more favorably. After a sharp slide following his reelection, independents turned their opinions of Obama around at the beginning of 2014. Over the past year, that s escalated. And since ratings from Democrats and Republicans are more stable, that shift by independents moves the needle a lot.Multiple factors probably account for the dramatic change, but the improving economy and the contrast between Donald Trump s buffoonish style and Obama s leadership have to be considered. Trump is definitely having an effect among Latino voters, where Obama is up even higher than the average   almost +15%. Trump calling for a wall on the U.S.   Mexico border and describing Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists is not a good look for the Republican Party.Obama has already said he will be out on the campaign trail for the Democratic nominee   most likely Hillary Clinton   and it has been decades since a sitting president used his office to campaign for his chosen successor (Gore pushed Clinton away in 2000, and Reagan was too ill to campaign for Bush in 1988, while George W. Bush was enormously unpopular in 2008 and McCain wanted nothing to do with him).A popular president who appeals to both Independents and the party base is a huge asset going into an election against an opponent who is both historically unpopular and who has built his campaign based on offending key members of the Democratic coalition (women, Latinos).Obama (and Biden) won t be a drag on the Democratic ticket. They could be the key to a huge victory.Featured image via Flickr",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"The left is truly becoming unhinged! The tension is high and the stakes are even higher in Washington as the Senate goes forward with debate on a bill to repeal Obamacare. While the US Senate voted today to open debate on the Obamacare bill, screams from far left protestors erupted from the Senate gallery. This far left mob chanted phrases such as  Kill the Bill,   Don t Kill Us,  and  Shame. The protesters interrupted the proceedings before the calling of the roll for nearly two minutes. It then took several minutes for the Sergeant of Arms and federal officers to remove the group of far left protestors. Many official Congressional votes require the gallery visitors to be given passes by legislators. It is highly likely that Democratic legislators gave these protestors access to the gallery.The emotional return of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to the Senate for the vote, after he was recently diagnosed with brain cancer is sure to put more pressure on nervous Republicans who have been opposed or reluctant to commit to support the Republican plan.John McCain:  I hope again we can rely on humility on our need to cooperate, on our dependence on each other, to learn how to trust each other again, and by so doing better serve the people who elected us. Stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio, television and the internet. To hell with them! Despite uncertainty, the administration is predicting victory.

"The Democrat s war on mostly  ugly women Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell believes that Donald Trump will ultimately lose the support of women because of his past comments, arguing that there are  more ugly women  in the United States than attractive women.Rendell, a former two-term governor in the Keystone State, made the remarks to the Washington Post in a piece on Trump s attempt to make inroads with suburban voters, particularly in the Philadelphia suburbs. He told the Post s Dave Weigel that for every woman he wins, he ll lose 1 1/2 or two GOP women voters. Will he have some appeal to working-class Dems in Levittown or Bristol? Sure,  Rendell told the Post.  For every one he ll lose 1 1/2 , two Republican women. Trump s comments like  You can t be a 10 if you re flat-chested,  that ll come back to haunt him. There are probably more ugly women in America than attractive women,  Rendell added.  People take that stuff personally.

"Rush Limbaugh weighed in on what he thinks happened when Bill clinton met up with AG Loretta Lynch for 30 minutes at the Phoenix airport. The big question to ask in all this is what does Lynch mean by primarily? Doesn t she incriminate herself by opening up the possibility that there could have been conversation about the case before her that involves Hillary Clinton? According to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, her seemingly impromptu meeting with former President Bill Clinton earlier this week was  primarily social,  but conservative talker Rush Limbaugh isn t convinced. I did see President Clinton at the Phoenix airport as he was leaving, and he spoke to myself and my husband on the plane,  Lynch told Phoenix news outlet KNXV-TV Monday.  Our conversation was a great deal about his grandchildren. It was primarily social, about our travels and he mentioned golf he played in Phoenix. Radio talk show host and conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh speaks at  An Evenining With Rush Limbaugh  event May 3, 2007 in Novi, Michigan. The event was sponsored by WJR radio station as part of their 85th birthday celebration festivities.But Limbaugh feels a few too many things lined up for the meeting, which has been criticized given the fact Lynch is overseeing an investigation into Hillary Clinton s private email server, to be a spontaneous social call. So Clinton just happens to be told that Loretta Lynch is arriving soon when he just happens to be arriving to depart at Sky Harbor International Airport?  Limbaugh asked during his radio show Thursday.  [W]e are supposed to believe here that Bill Clinton, a 70-year-old man with a history of heart trouble, played golf in Phoenix where it was 108, 110 degrees? Limbaugh doesn t seem to buy Lynch s recanting of the meeting. Instead, he feels the discussion   which the radio personality believes was intended to be clandestine   involved Bill Clinton blackmailing Lynch, telling her to drop the email issue all together. During his program, Limbaugh posed another possibility, in which Bill Clinton praised the attorney general and reminded her he  was one of the people that told Barack Obama to put you in this job,  adding that he s been one of her  champions  for  I can t tell you how long.

"Donald Trump is having another bad day.Earlier this week, Trump finally contacted the family of one of the four American soldiers who were killed in Niger.Unfortunately, Trump was an asshole. He knew what he signed up for, but I guess it hurts anyway,  Trump told Army Sgt. La David Johnson s widow Myeshia over the phone while she and the rest of Johnson s family were meeting his flag-draped coffin.Florida Democratic Rep. Frederica Wilson passed her account of Trump s insensitive words to the media. She was crying the whole time, and when she hung up the phone, she looked at me and said,  He didn t even remember his name.  That s the hurting part,  Wilson told MSNBC.  He was almost like joking. He said,  Well, I guess you knew    something to the effect that  he knew what he was getting into when he signed up, but I guess it hurts anyway.  You know, just matter-of-factly, that this is what happens, anyone who is signing up for military duty is signing up to die. That s the way we interpreted it. It was horrible. It was insensitive. It was absolutely crazy, unnecessary. I was livid. On Wednesday morning, Trump attacked Wilson and accused her of lying. Trump even claimed to have proof.Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2017As it turns out, Wilson has witnesses, including Johnson s own grieving mother, who confirmed Wilson s account to the Washington Post. President Trump did disrespect my son and my daughter and also me and my husband,  Cowanda Jones-Johnson said. She went on to confirm that Wilson s account was accurate.Faced with real proof, the White House was forced to walk back Trump s attack. This president cares deeply,  a White House official told the Sentinel.  Maybe he said something that was misunderstood, but he certainly cares about fallen servicemen and women. In short, the White House just basically confirmed that Donald Trump acted like an asshole toward Johnson s family, and also that Rep. Wilson was telling the truth.Trump owes her and Johnson s family a very public apology.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Buckle up. Elizabeth Warren, continuing her crusade for the little guy, wrote a letter to FBI director James Comey over their transparency with Hillary s emails, because they didn t have that same transparency when investigating the big banks. In fact, they usually don t release anything when there s no indictment. They changed their standards for releasing information with Hillary, and Warren wants to know why that same standard can t be used on Wall Street executives. Your recent actions with regard to the investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton provide a clear precedent for releasing additional information about the investigation of the parties responsible for the financial crisis These new standards present a compelling case for public transparency around the fate of the FCIC referrals. If Secretary Clinton s email server was of sufficient  interest  to establish a new FBI standard of transparency, then surely the criminal prosecution of those responsible for the 2008 financial crisis should be subject to the same level of transparency. She s more than right; if Hillary s emails are of sufficient interest to release as much information as possible, then why isn t the information on those who have been proven to cause harm to millions of Americans by crashing the economy of the same interest? It should actually be of bigger interest than the witch hunt against Hillary.The FBI initially released information in response to several FOIA requests from the press, and sent more material to Congress. However, they didn t send over every last, little, tiny bit. The chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), incensed that they d spurn him like that, subpoenaed the full file earlier this week.Republicans all over Congress are pitching a hell of a tantrum over the FBI not releasing every last scrap of paper, but they really couldn t care less that the FBI didn t release anything after the Department of Justice decided not to prosecute eleven bankers that had a hand in destroying the economy. Why?Simple. When it s Hillary Clinton, everything has to be changed. She must be guilty of something; Republicans and Hillary-haters know things. When it s people who actually harmed America, though? Meh. Not that important why nobody was prosecuted. Here s hoping that Warren s letter has an impact on Comey, because we deserve to know exactly why bankers weren t prosecuted.Featured image by Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

Oops!Hillary Clinton s family s charities are refiling at least five years of tax returns after an investigation revealed they had misreported tens of millions of dollars in donations from governments. The charities  errors generally took the form of under-reporting or over-reporting donations from foreign governments, or in other instances, omitted to break out government donations entirely when reporting revenue, the charities confirmed to Reuters, which uncovered the mistakes. Following the discovery, the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative said they will be refiling multiple annual tax returns and may audit returns extending as far back as 15 years in case there have been other errors.

"Recently, Donald Trump s New York campaign co-chair, Carl Paladino, did what Trump fans do best and made some incredibly racist remarks about the President and First Lady. Asked about his wish for Barack Obama by a weekly Buffalo, New York, paper, Paladino explained that he hoped Barack Obama would be caught having sex with a cow and die from Mad Cow Disease. As for Michelle, he explained that he wanted her to  return to being a male  and released in Africa to live among the apes.Naturally, Paladino s racist and hateful rhetoric   the exact sort that is, unfortunately, popular among the Stupid Part of America   didn t exactly make him friends outside of his racist little bubble. In fact, some (almost everyone) had a bit of an issue with the fact that he serves on the Buffalo school board. Words matter, Mr. Paladino,  School Board President Barbara Seals Nevergold said during a meeting intended to oust the Trump-loving bigot.  Our president, the Commander in Chief of this nation for the last eight years, Mrs. Obama, our First Lady, and Mrs. Valerie Jarrett, special presidential council [SIC] are all African-Americans. Among other things, they are accomplished, intelligent, beautiful people and that s not just my opinion. The impact on children of color, especially African-American children is incalculable,  she continued.  How do we encourage them to use their God-given talents to soar, to reach for the stars, when a sitting board member responsible for their education demonstrates such contempt of their role models? Nevergold added that Paladino s unmitigated and hateful, racist and misogynist, rhetoric  has reached a level that is almost guaranteed to adversely impact students of color. Noting that his disgusting behavior  demonstrate such a lack of responsible leadership,  the school board president explained that people from all over the state had shared their views on Paladino s actions. They would like me to tell you,  You re fired,  she said, demanding Paladino s resignation as the room exploded in applause.While Trump fans vigorously defend him, it is impossible for a rational person to believe that Paladino could possibly serve on the school board while simultaneously believing that black people are apes, gorillas, or any other primate conservatives seem to use interchangeably.Paladino, as is expected from any racist coward, skipped the meeting entirely rather than answer for what he has done.

" Our vision of the world ? Where are the Catholics who re against this scam? The Catholic church has been hijacked by leftists who re following the one world global agenda in the name of social justice: Fossil fuel is the cheapest form of energy man has these days, and these people have the audacity to talk about  the cry of the poor  while advocating for things that will make it far more difficult for them to exist and survive?????  The only thing that makes life unfair is the delusion that it should be fair.    Steve Maraboli Does this political agenda mean the church is now giving up its tax exempt status? You can t have it both ways. Please speak up against this! The ten-point plan advanced by the bishops calls for the adoption of  a fair, transformational and legally binding global agreement based on our vision of the world.  In the lead-up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris next month, a group of cardinals, patriarchs and bishops have called for a radical, legally binding international climate agreement that mandates, among other things, complete global decarbonization by 2050 and  an end to the fossil fuel era.  The nine prelates claim to represent  the Catholic Church from the five continents  and will address participants in the COP 21 in Paris taking place from November 30 to December 11, 2015. Signers include Archbishop Joseph Kurtz, the president of the U.S. Bishops Conference, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, president of the union of European Bishops Conferences (COMECE) and Cardinal Oswald Gracias, the Archbishop of Bombay. Drawing inspiration from Pope Francis  encyclical letter on the environment Laudato S , the bishops express the  widely-held hope that a just and legally binding climate agreement will emerge from the negotiations of the COP 21 in Paris,  and to this end, advance  a ten-point policy proposal.  In their appeal, the bishops reference the  dramatic acceleration of climatic change,  which, they say,  is the result of unrestrained human activity.  They also claim that this ecological phenomenon is primarily due to  excessive reliance on fossil fuels.   The Pope and Catholic Bishops from five continents,  the declaration states,  appeal for a drastic reduction in the emission of carbon dioxide and other toxic gases.  Human-induced climate change, the bishops continue, is having a  dramatic impact  on  sea levels, extreme weather events, deteriorating ecosystems and the loss of biodiversity.

"Eric Holder was the king of extortion from big companies. He had it all figured out and was able to redistribute money from these  settlements  to the favorite radical group of the day. That this went on at our Justice Department is the height of hypocrisy.The Justice Department announced Wednesday it will no longer allow prosecutors to strike settlement agreements with big companies directing them to make payouts to outside groups, ending an Obama-era practice that Republicans decried as a  slush fund  that padded the accounts of liberal interest groups.In a memo sent to 94 U.S. attorneys  offices early Wednesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he would end the practice that allowed companies to meet settlement burdens by giving money to groups that were neither victims nor parties to the case.Sessions said the money should, instead, go to the Treasury Department or victims. When the federal government settles a case against a corporate wrongdoer, any settlement funds should go first to the victims and then to the American people not to bankroll third-party special interest groups or the political friends of whoever is in power,  Sessions said in a statement. This bill is oversight and action.

The government basically extorted money from the banks and then incentivized the banks to settle by giving the money to third-party organizations. How convenient, right?  It was a way to redistribute billions to radical organizations like La Raza!So far, investigators have accounted for $3 billion paid to  non-victim entities .

"The right-wing pastor who posted a cartoon of Hillary Clinton in black-face just got his a** handed to him by CNN.Pastor Mark Burns has been one of Donald Trump s biggest cheerleaders. On his church website, he bragged about his military experience in the Army and claimed that he graduated from North Greenville University with a Bachelor of Science.The only problem is that neither of those claims are even remotely true, which means Burns has been lying to his congregation and the American people.During an interview with CNN host Victor Blackwell, Burns was taken by surprise when called out for posting false information about himself.When asked if he attended the university, Burns said that he had, but then Blackwell confronted Burns about the claim on his website that he actually graduated. As it turns out, Burns only attended for one semester.Burns whined and claimed that the interview was supposed to be  off the record,  but Blackwell made it clear that he  didn t agree to that. Burns continuing complaining and accused Blackwell of character assassination. This is not fair at all,  Burns whined.  I thought we were doing a profile and all of a sudden you re here to try to destroy my character. I m not here to destroy your character,  Blackwell said before getting back to the results of CNN s investigation.Blackwell proceeded to grill Burns and revealed that not only did Burns not graduate from North Greenville University, he didn t serve six years in the Army either. He only briefly served in the National Guard.Here s the video via YouTube.Burns later released a statement claiming that he only lied in his biography because he wanted to be taken seriously as a pastor. As a young man starting my church in Greenville, South Carolina, I overstated several details of my biography because I was worried I wouldn t be taken seriously as a new pastor. This was wrong. I wasn t truthful then and I have to take full responsibility for my actions. Burns, who has raked in the money as a televangelist, has built his empire on a foundation of lies that automatically disqualifies him from serving as a so-called  man of God. This man lied to become a pastor and he has been lying to his congregation ever since.But Burns could not even take full responsibility for his sins as he blamed the media and claimed that he is only being outed because he is a black man who supports Donald Trump. I do also want to set the record straight about why this attack is happening   because I am a black man supporting Donald Trump for president. For too long, African-American votes have been taken for granted by Democratic politicians, and enough is enough.

Trump s slate includes William Johnson, one of the country s most prominent white nationalists.[ ]Johnson leads the American Freedom Party, a group that  exists to represent the political interests of White Americans  and aims to preserve  the customs and heritage of the European American people.  The AFP has never elected a candidate of its own and possesses at most a few thousand members, but it is  arguably the most important white nationalist group in the country,  according to Mark Potok, a senior fellow for the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which tracks hate groups.In an interview with Mother Jones magazine, Johnson said,  I can be a white nationalist and be a strong supporter of Donald Trump and be a good example to everybody. This is not Johnson s first work in service of the Trump campaign. He was the money behind white power robocalls promoting Trump in seven states.Trump has based his campaign on blatant racist appeals to white, conservative-leaning voters, in the hopes that they power him to victory. His campaign and party chairman Reince Priebus have indicated that they hope to appeal to rust belt voters who have gone Democratic in the last few elections in states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Ohio.The risk of that strategy is that it also motivates key elements of the coalition that elected President Barack Obama twice   women, Latinos, and blacks   as well as moderate and liberal white voters.Enlisting the aid of white nationalists may provide some form of temporary boost to Trump, but it is likely to be an albatross that can be hung around his neck in the fall election by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.Featured image via Flickr",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"21st Century Wire says Why shouldn t borders be protected?  It is a fair question Tucker is asking Enrique Morones, founder of  Border Angels  (pro-immigration advocate group) in a recent discussion about President Trump s 10 point immigration plan.Morones was quick to call Trump s position on illegal immigration  racist  and  xenophobic  yet seemed to have no knowledge that the policies of Mexico are much more harsh with regard to illegal immigration. In Mexico illegal immigration is a felony, illegal immigrants can face deportations (based even on financial viability, physical and mental health) and up to 10 years in prison for repeat offenders. Tucker also points out that Mexico only allows 4% of their applicants clemency whereas the US grants 49% and Morones again seems completely unaware of the facts being presented.Certainly it is a sensitive topic that should be open for debate by all citizens but the critical thinkers out there are likely wondering  Are Morones and many of those on the left confusing the difference between enforcing legal US immigration policies and acts of hatred? Why does he not hold Mexico to the same standard as the US?

"21st Century Wire says OK. As political endorsements go, this one is about as sexy as a box of Wheaties.This exciting development comes just hours after Cruz was declared the winner in Utah s GOP primary contest.Now if it was Barbara giving the honors, then we might be intrigued  Of course, we should be so lucky   Huff PostFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is endorsing Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for president, Politico reported. Bush, who dropped out of the race last month, confirmed the endorsement on Wednesday in an email from the Cruz campaign. Ted is a consistent, principled conservative who has demonstrated the ability to appeal to voters and win primary contests, including yesterday s Utah caucus, Bush said on Facebook.The statement also went out in an email to supporters from the Cruz campaign, the New York Times said.   Jeeebbbbbbbb. For the sake of our party and country, we must move to overcome the divisiveness and vulgarity Donald Trump has brought into the political arena, or we will certainly lose our chance to defeat the Democratic nominee and reverse President Obama s failed policies,  Bush said Continue this story at Huff PostREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"It s good to know there are a few Hollywood celebrities who haven t bought into Obama s false messiah B.S During an appearance before the U.K. s House of Lords on Tuesday, Hollywood actress and human rights advocate Angelina Jolie spoke out about how Islamic State group militants use sexual violence as a means to perpetuate terrorism   and about how we need strong leadership (unlike that of President Barack Obama) to overcome this threat.Jolie s excoriating speech laid bare just how anemic and pitiful Obama s response to ISIS has been, and how ISIS is being allowed to build a society based on rape, violence, and of course Shariah law. They are dictating it as policy beyond what we have seen before,  Jolie said.  They are saying,  We should do this, this is the right way to build a society, so we tell you to rape. Islamic militants are basically building a civilization not focused on growing food or educating children, but rather on kidnapping, enslaving and raping women, to perpetuate the endless cycle of terrorism, and Obama has allowed these barbaric radical Muslims to thrive. The most aggressive terrorist group in the world today knows what we know, knows that it is a very effective weapon and they are using it as a centrepoint of their terror and their way of destroying communities and families, and attacking and dehumanising,  Jolie explained. For over 10 years, I had been visiting the field and meeting families and survivors of sexual violence who felt for so long that their voices simply didn t mater, they weren t heard, and they carried a great shame,  Jolie continued.She added that we need  a very, very strong response at this time  to stop this horrific behavior. Of course, we have been calling on Obama to make that strong response for years, but he s far more interested in race baiting back home than dealing a death blow to radical Islam.Jolie does have some measure of expertise in the matters she s speaking of. As she told the Houses of Parliament, she has been campaigning for Middle Eastern victims of sexual abuse for over a decade (H/T The Gateway Pundit).Below is an excerpt of Jolie s address, this part dealing with some of her encounters with young rape victims.https://youtu.be/KBmHnzjgwSkIt seems like Jolie is someone whose words President Obama should heed. Will our president actually take the time though to listen, learn and adjust his failed strategy against what he once referred to as the  JV team? Only time will tell   but we wouldn t want to put any money on it. Via: Conservative Tribune",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"What s a million dollars between friends? To hell with human rights violations Hillary s got a campaign to win!A major Clinton Foundation donor regularly arrests dissidents and brutally tortures them to extract confessions, according to a new report from Amnesty International.The New York Times reports that despite promises of reform, the Moroccan government continues to use  violent interrogation tactics  to  crush dissent. Moroccan King Mohammed VI recently hosted Bill and Chelsea Clinton at a Clinton Global Initiative conference in Marrakech, where guests were  chauffeured across the city to an opulent 56-room palace that boasts a private collection of Arabian horses, overlooks the snow-capped Atlas Mountains and serves a fine-dining menu of  biolight  cuisine,  according to the Washington Post.    During the conference Bill cited  Morocco s longstanding friendship to my family,  and thanked the king, who pledged as much as $500,000 toward the construction of the Clinton Library, as well as the OCP Corporation, a government-owned phosphate mining company that has donated at least $1 million to the Clinton Foundation. In interviews with POLITICO, former OCP miners described witnessing verbal and physical abuse doled out by the government against member of a minority advocating for independence in Western Sahara.Amnesty International secretary general Salil Shetty blasted the Moroccan government in a statement, saying:  Morocco s leaders portray the image of a liberal, human-rights-friendly country. But as long as the threat of torture hangs over detention and dissent that image will just be a mirage. According to the report, Moroccan dissidents are repeatedly subjected to  beatings, stress positions, asphyxiation, simulated drowning, psychological and sexual violence,  as a means of securing confessions for alleged crimes against the state. One tactic, known as the  roast chicken,  involves  suspending detainees from an iron bar by their wrists and knees. It is not known whether Bill Clinton met with any Moroccan detainees while hobnobbing at the Clinton Foundation event, which featured a  lavish palm-tree-lined golf resort with a cocktail reception featuring Moroccan hors d oeuvres and a saxophonist serenading about 50 donors.

"The election of former reality television star Donald Trump stirred up a variety of emotions in American voters   and most of them were bad. Everyone that voted against Trump   which was the majority of Americans   likely felt combinations of disbelief, depression, disgust, fear, and anger that such an unqualified, undeserving human being could somehow come out on top despite losing the popular vote.Recently on the WTF podcast, singer Bruce Springsteen summed up how many of us feel about Trump s upcoming presidency perfectly. When host Marc Maron asked him if he was scared of what the new Commander in Chief might mean for the future of our country, Springsteen said, Yeah. Of course. How could you not be? Then Sprucesteen elaborated, dropping the devastating truthbomb that all of us feel. He continued: I ve felt disgust before, but never the kind of fear that you feel now. It s as simple as the fear of, is someone simply competent enough to do this particular job? Do they simply have the pure competence to be put in the position of such responsibility? Remarking on the fear mongering tactics that Trump used to appeal to his gullible supporters, Springsteen said he understood why Trump was able to attract support from his voters, but made sure to acknowledge the fact that they d all been played for fools. He said: I think if you were effected deeply by the industrialization, globalization, and the technological advances, and you have been left behind; and somebody comes along and tells you  I m gonna bring all the jobs back. Don t worry about it. They re all coming back.  You re concerned about America changing, the browning of America  I m gonna build a wall. These are all very simplistic, but very powerful and simple ideas. They re lies. They can t occur.

"Donald Trump told his supporters to engage in gun violence during a campaign stop on Tuesday.Discussing the possibility that Hillary Clinton would be elected President and have the ability to choose Supreme Court Justices, Trump said: If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks. Though the second amendment folks, maybe there is   Rob Flaherty, part of the rapid response operation for the Clinton campaign asked,: Did Donald Trump just call for someone to shoot Hillary Clinton? The comments come as Trump has been hyping the conspiracy theory that the general election will be  rigged  by Clinton and the government. Many view those comments as an acknowledgement from Trump that nearly every single poll taken over the last few weeks shows him losing badly, both nationally and in key swing states like Pennsylvania and Ohio.Trump has repeatedly embraced conspiracy theories and fringe personalities since running for President, including the council of dirty trickster Roger Stone (who has accused the Clinton and Bush families of murder) and 9/11 truther Alex Jones.A few months ago, Trump bragged that he could shoot someone in the middle of the street and still be supported.The call for gun violence echoes that of Tea Party Senate candidate Sharron Angle, who proposed  2nd Amendment remedies  as the cure for liberalism in her 2010 race in Nevada. Angle was beaten in that election by Senator Harry Reid.The National Rifle Association has endorsed Trump, and is running a multi-million dollar ad campaign in favor of his presidential bid. By contrast, multiple groups involved in gun violence prevention have backed Hillary Clinton, who has vowed to fight the gun lobby if elected president. Gabrielle Giffords, subject of an attempted assassination, has endorsed Clinton and made a speech in favor of her campaign at the recent Democratic National Convention.Featured image via YouTube",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"On Saturday, Paul Ryan posted a photo to his Instagram. The photo was a mass selfie of a large group of Capitol Hill interns. It wasn t long before social media commentators noticed something very wrong with the photo.In his post, Ryan wrote: I think this sets a record for the most number of #CapitolHill interns in a single selfie. #SpeakerSelfie. So here s the photo:Photo via InstagramThat s a huge sea of white people. Now, I am sure that the interns shown in the photo have worked very hard to get to where they are; however, it is very problematic to see that the people who aid lawmakers don t even come close to representing the United States. Screenshot from InstagramScreenshot from InstagramThis isn t just a matter of one photo inaccurately describing the racial makeup of Congressional aides. According to a report released in 2015 by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, minorities are severely underrepresented on the Capital Hill. One of the key findings of the report is that: Although people of color make up over 36 percent of the U.S. population and over 28 percent of the citizen voting-age population, they represent only 7.1 percent of top Senate staffers.  They report also says that,   Senate offices representing states with large Hispanic and AfricanAmerican populations hire few senior staffers of color. Commentators quickly made the connection between the lack of diversity in the photo and the GOP  autopsy report  that concluded that the Republican Party is going to go extinct if they do not reach out to minorities and try to get them to join their ranks.Republicans hate hiring mandates but they sure know how to make a case for them, as we can clearly see from the photo.Featured image from screenshot via Instagram",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

Women who have been intimidated and silenced by the Clinton Crime Syndicate in the past, have recently been inspired by other women who are bravely speaking out against this serial pervert and the woman who has enabled Bill s war against women for decades Since returning to the campaign trail as an advocate for Hillary, Bill Clinton has been harried by renewed interest in his past sexual misconduct as well as Hillary s alleged role in intimidating his victims into silence.Roger Stone, author of the New York Times bestselling  The Clinton s War On Women , claims that he has personal knowledge of previously unknown victims who are preparing to come forward with accusations against the former president. I identified 24 women who ve been assaulted by Bill Clinton,  Stone said on The Sean Hannity Show.  Now some of these women are still terrified. Some of them have had IRS audits. Some of them have had their families threatened. But others have come forward. Are you saying there s women whose names we don t know that are mentioned in your book or not mentioned in your book that are going to come forward and start telling those stories?  Sean asked. Yes, I think it s very probable,  Stone responded.  Not all of them because some of them are still terrified, their families have been threatened, their lives have been threatened. Are we talking about affairs, or are we talking about assaults?  asked Hannity. We re talking about assaults,  declared Stone.  I don t want to get out ahead of myself but I think as Broaddrick, and [Kathleen] Willey, and Jones speak out, other women are encouraged who have been assaulted, who have been threatened by Hillary are encouraged by the courage of those three women.

Spicer, a Patriots fan, declined the offer. Mild laughs were had. Gronkowski then disappeared, presumably to cause more mischief in other parts of the building.It s not surprising that the tight end performed a bit like this. That he was wearing a shirt while doing it was a bit of a shock.Right after this video was posted Facebook comments were brutal about how unprofessional it was to have this guy pop into the briefing.

We consider this to be much more important than what happened today.6 OF THE TOP  ANTICS  FROM WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFINGS UNDER OBAMA   JAY CARNEY S NOT FUNNY BUT SERIOUS  GAFFES : 1. When he said he knows 3 people named  Hilary Rosen.  After Obama adviser Hilary Rosen said Ann Romney hadn t worked a day in her life, it was discovered Rosen had visited the White House numerous times. When questioned on it, Carney claimed he knew 3 separate women named  Hilary Rosen. 2. That one time he stumbled when asked why the Obama Administration withheld a crucial Benghazi email.3. That day when he called a reporter s repeated questions on Kathleen Sebelius  lame. 4. That time he admitted White House staff knew of the IRS scandal and didn t tell Obama.5. That time he admitted that the Obama Budget wouldn t balance.6. That moment when he finally admitted Obama s  Keep Your Plan  promise wasn t true.Shouldn t the liberal snowflakes be outraged at what Jay Carney did? ",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

In a 2014 Facebook post, Feiglin said that Palestinians should be  concentrated  in  tent encampments  and the  formerly populated areas  to be  shelled with maximum fire power.  Any  nests of resistance  would then be  exterminated  in the  event that any should remain. Any civilians who are later allowed to stay in the area  will be required to publicly sign a declaration of loyalty to Israel, and receive a blue ID card similar to that of the Arabs of East Jerusalem.

Trump s not happy, at all.This week, Baldwin skewered Trump s Twitter obsession.

Kellyanne,  referring to campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, played by SNL s Kate McKinnon,  I just retweeted the best tweet. I mean wow, what a great, smart tweet. When advisors reminded Trump that he was in a security briefing, Baldwin s Trump replied,  He s 16, he s in high school, and I really did retweet him. Seriously, this is real.  Trump s advisors tried to steer him back to the situation in Syria but Trump said,  God, Seth seems so cool. His Twitter bio says he wants to make America great again. That s when McKinnon s Conway dropped the truth bomb about why Trump really tweets:Trump tweets to much to  distract the media from his business conflicts and the scary people in his cabinet,  but in Trump s words the real reason is because his  brain is bad. But what s Donald Trump if he can t brag about something he had absolutely nothing to do with:As the adults in the room continued to admonish Trump for his incessant tweeting, he disputed the fact that it was preventing him from focusing on his work.

I fully agree that each of these people do in fact have the right to protest how they see fit, but the issue here is that they are using platforms to get the attention they want that are literally funded by the very citizenship that they are showing such a huge disrespect for.Use your free time to protest, not the time in which I as an American citizen am paying for.H/T [ Fox ]",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0

"Infamous Donald Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson has once again proven just how pitiful and ridiculous The Donald and his entire team is. In speaking about President Barack Obama s recent endorsement of Hillary Clinton, Pierson revealed that she actually thinks that supporters of Bernie Sanders are going to switch sides and vote GOP. Actually, she said   with full confidence   that she thinks HALF of Sanders  fans are going to switch over to team Trump.It doesn t get any more idiotic than this, and it s almost hard to believe. When Jake Tapper asked Pierson how many Sanders supporters will jump ship to avoid voting for Clinton, Pierson said: I think the polls are showing, one in four, maybe, I think it s going to be half at some point. There is a transition happening, not just in this country but globally, the consciousness is definitely changing, and younger voters want to see the status quo busted up. That is absolute madness, and Pierson has mocked the intelligence of Bernie s followers by saying they would vote for a racist, misogynistic Republican. First of all, Trump has insulted their chosen candidate several times, referring to him as  Crazy Bernie. He s also encouraged violence against Sanders supporters that dare to attend his rallies. Another thing Trump is in denial about is the fact that Sanders will probably be giving Clinton his endorsement soon, and urge his supporters to throw their support behind the former Secretary of State as well.Now, Sanders fans might not be happy that Clinton is leading the Democratic party, but most of them know that Trump needs to be stopped by any means possible. According to a recent poll, the real numbers reveal that less than a quarter of Sanders voters might switch over to Trump. The polls also revealed that 71 percent of Sanders backers would choose Clinton over Trump   but when has the Trump campaign ever really been concerned with facts?You can watch Pierson spew this pro-Trump nonsense in the video below:Featured image is a screenshot",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"UPDATE: Nordstrom stock closed up slightly today, after taking a hit yesterday following President Trump s tweet.President Trump tweeted about Nordstrom dumping his daughter s brand today and the company is seeing an immediate, negative market reaction. Nordstrom and its outlet store, Nordstrom Rack, announced last week that they were dumping Ivanka s line of shoes and accessories because of poor sales and likely pressure from liberal boycotters who made Nordstrom a top target in their anti-Trump actions.Here is his tweet: My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom.

"Donald Trump is an insane narcissist. We all know that. However, actor Matt Damon just revealed just how bad Trump s narcissism is   and it is positively frightening when it comes to such a person having the nuclear codes. As we re all well aware, Donald Trump owns bunches of gaudy buildings around the world. Since they are so unusual, it s only natural that they could be great locations for shooting movies. However, with Trump being Trump, there was a crazy catch that showed just how much of a narcissistic bully the orange man that is currently squatting in the Oval Office is.Apparently, in order to have access to Trump s buildings for the purpose of filming, directors were forced to allow Trump to have a part in whatever was being filmed. Damon says of this bizarre detail: The deal was that if you wanted to shoot in one of his buildings, you had to write him in a part. Martin Brest had to write something in  Scent of a Woman    and the whole crew was in on it. You have to waste an hour of your day with a bullshit shot: Donald Trump walks in and Al Pacino s like,  Hello, Mr. Trump!    you had to call him by name   and then he exits. You waste a little time so that you can get the permit, and then you can cut the scene out. But I guess in  Home Alone 2 they left it in. Damon went on to express dismay at the way Trump is running the nation and says of Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation into the Russian hacking that took place in the 2016 election: [H]opefully his investigation is going smoothly. He can t wrap things up soon enough, as far as I m concerned. Damon also had quite a few things to say about Trump s white supremacist fan boys: [T]o see these young, aggrieved, white boys walking with their torches and screaming  Jews will not replace us!  It was just shocking. Then the night that the president [made his]  many sides  comment was absolutely abhorrent. Matt Damon is right on all accounts. It is shocking. Everything that is happening is shocking, and not in a good way. Donald Trump is destabilizing our democracy right before our very eyes, and the people in a position to do something about it will do nothing. Hopefully, Mueller finishes up soon, and we get rid of these people post haste.Featured image via Bill Pugliano/Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Fox News  Harris Faulkner BLOWS UP the WHOLE Russia Collusion Theory with ONE SMART QUESTION that we re sure the media will ignore!On Sunday, Fox News anchor Harris Faulkner asked the best question to those who believe both, that there was collusion and that Jared Kushner had or reached out for a secret back channel with Russia after the election: If it s true, wouldn t that signify that there was not collusion? Why would you need a back channel with the Kremlin if, in fact, you already had several established?

"The Republican Party has been a thorn in the side of the president since he took office. They have challenged his policies at almost every corner and at times just for the sake of it, thus preventing the country from running smoothly. Even now, as the president is close to the end of his final term, the GOP is not letting up. In their latest attempt at obstructionism, the Republican Party is attempting to scuttle the president s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. President Barack Obama appeared on Fox News Sunday for the first time as president and had a few things to say about Republican obstructionism.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHqWf81IbDA]The president wants the GOP to simply do one thing, which is to give Judge Merrick Garland a hearing in order for the American people to be given an opportunity to see what his nominee is all about. The president said: I think that people will evolve as they get familiar with Judge Garland s record, as it becomes apparent that the overwhelming majority of the American people think that the president should nominate someone to the Supreme Court and the Senate should now do its constitutional job and give him a hearing  Our goal is to just make sure that the senate does its job and treats him fairly. The Republicans want the next president to nominate a justice to the Supreme Court, hoping that a Republican president would appoint a conservative justice. The president went on to add that never has a Republican nominee for the Supreme Court not at least had a hearing. Yet, here are the Republicans yet again scuttling by preventing the president from doing his job and not doing their constitutional duties as well.The Republicans continue to obstruct but let s hope that they remain on the sidelines come November and we don t have to deal with a GOP presidential administration.

"We ve long been suspicious of Russian meddling in our political process, with intelligence officials going so far as to say they re confident they know Russia hacked various email systems, including that of the DNC. With Trump s election, Russia sees a huge victory as their puppet prepares to take office.One Russian governor, Viktor Nazarov, actually, literally said, according to CBS News: It turns out that United Russia won the elections in America. United Russia is Putin s political party, and not Russia itself. Regardless, that is still a bold proclamation to make, whether he s talking about Putin meddling or just a U.S. puppet government for Putin to use to strengthen Russia. Russia suffers from a crippled economy thanks to sanctions, and they seem to see us as their ticket out of all that.It s more likely that see us as their ticket to restored power so they re once again on equal footing with us. Hillary wouldn t have done that   the Democrats have taken a strong line against Russia, as have most Republicans. With the bromance that exists between Trump and Putin, though, Russia probably hopes that Congress will give in to their new leader.Putin, of course, denies that Russia did anything at all with our electoral process despite NSA claims that he definitely did. He claimed conspiracy theory, saying that the American left was using this theory as a distraction. If his governors and other officials can t keep from saying that Russia was the big winner in our elections, though, then what are we really to think?As Boris Zilberman, an expert on Russia, said: It s not that Putin is against the Democratic Party. He s more against the United States and (for) whatever may push Russian interests. How convenient for Putin, then, that his best American buddy, Trump, got elected. It s sickening to think that Russia might have been the big winner of our elections, but it s hard to ignore Russian officials who say so.Featured image via Greg Baker-Pool/Getty Images and Joe Raedle/Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Donald Trump just posted a provable lie on Twitter that makes him look like a complete hypocrite.In retaliation against the Washington Post for correctly reporting that Trump is displaying fake Time magazine covers of himself at his golf resorts, Trump attacked the Post as  fake news  and took aim at Amazon, which owns the Post, seemingly threatening the Internet giant and accusing it of not paying their taxes.The #AmazonWashingtonPost, sometimes referred to as the guardian of Amazon not paying internet taxes (which they should) is FAKE NEWS!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 28, 2017Not only is there no such thing as  internet taxes,  Newsweek pointed out that if Trump is somehow referencing Amazon s legal battle to not pay state sales taxes he is spreading fake news because Amazon lost in court and has been paying sales taxes in the 45 states that have a sales tax ever since.The president may be referring to Amazon s years-long fight against paying state sales taxes. But Amazon lost that battle, and recently has been adding states where it does pay sales tax.Amazon now pays sales tax in all 45 states that have a sales tax. On April 1, Amazon began collecting sales taxes in Hawaii, Idaho, Maine and New Mexico, the last four holdouts. Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon do not have a state sales tax.If Trump was, in fact, referring to sales tax in his tweet, the tweet is fake news.Trump s tweet also smacks of hypocrisy since he actually does not pay his taxes. Trump has refused to release his tax returns and the only tax return we have seen shows that Trump may not have had to pay federal income taxes for two decades after he wrote off a $900 million business loss.Furthermore, Trump is currently suing the town of Briarcliff Manor, New York in an effort to force the town to cut the property taxes on his $38 million Westchester golf course and resort. Trump currently pays just $500,000, but he is trying to pay only half that amount by devaluing the worth of his own property despite bragging that it was worth $50 million on his 2016 financial disclosure forms.Trump has been disputing the taxes in court for years even though the town already gave him a generous tax break in 2008. Childishly, Trump sends a check every year marked  Paid Under Protest. Donald Trump is a hypocrite who lies through his teeth. And by attacking Amazon and the Washington Post, he is attacking Jeff Bezos, who just so happens to be a member of Trump s own American Technology Council. That will probably change soon.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Europe s new new take on our Statue of Liberty s poem: Give us your Sharia Law enforcers, your rapists and your trained ISIS jihadi s Unless we get a new President with a backbone and fight back against political correctness in America we re next. We can start by exposing the lie Obama told Americans about the Muslim invasion of the West, calling the male refugees looking for a free ride,  widows and orphans! As many as 5,000 trained jihadis are believed to be living freely in Europe today, according to the head of the European Union s policing agency Europol.Agency head Ron Wainwright said between 3,000 and 5,000 jihadis who have trained with the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) in the Middle East have been able to slip back into Europe. Europe is currently facing the highest terror threat in more than 10 years,  Wainwright said, speaking to the Germany newspaper Neue Osnabrucker Zeitung.  We can expect [ISIS] or other religious terror groups to stage an attack somewhere in Europe with the aim of achieving mass casualties among the civilian population. However, Wainwright said reports that the Islamic State is using the refugee/migrant crisis to sneak jihadis into Europe have been exaggerated. There is no concrete evidence terrorists are systematically using the flow of refugees to infiltrate Europe,  he commented.Meanwhile, in Hungary, police reported an increasing number of migrants have been able to circumvent the four-meter, barbed-wire fence to enter the country illegally. In January, 550 people were caught trying to pass the fence compared to 270 in December. During the first 20 days of February, 1,200 people were caught.Those that have succeeded have either cut the fence or climber over it.Also in Hungary, the central bank recently bought 112 handguns and 200,000 rounds of ammunition for its security company. The National Bank of Hungary justified its purchases citing potential terrorist threats as well as the migrant crisis.The bank controls the country s monetary policy, including price stability and exchange rates, and manages Hungary s foreign-exchange reserves. Its profits are paid into the government s budget and its losses are covered by taxpayers.Via: ClarionProjecth/t UK Daily Mail",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Marco Rubio was looming large in New Hampshire, but Chris Christie made Marco Rubio look very small on Saturday night.In a span of only a few minutes, Christie knocked Rubio off his game so badly that he ended up repeating the same line on multiple occasions even after the New Jersey governor accused him of being scripted.And it all started when Christie absolutely shredded Rubio s lack of leadership experience. You have not be involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable,  Christie said.  You just simply haven t. And the fact is   the fact when you talk about the Hezbollah Sanctions Act that you list as one of your accomplishments you just did, you weren t even there to vote for it. That s not leadership, that s truancy. Indeed, Rubio has been roundly criticized for not doing his job.According to Gov Track, Rubio has missed 14.1 percent of votes since 2011, and that percentage skyrocketed last year. Currently, he has missed up to 88 percent of votes in the Senate because he would rather be out campaigning. And that disqualifies Rubio from being president, Christie says. The fact is it does matter when you have to make decisions and be held accountable for them. It does matter when the challenges don t come on a list of a piece of paper of what to vote yes or no every day, but when the problems come in from the people that you serve.I like Marco Rubio, and he s a smart person and a good guy, but he simply does not have the experience to be president of the United States and make these decisions. Rubio responded by bringing up Christie s own lack of leadership during natural disasters and then he used a line that would get him stuck like a broken record for the next several minutes. Let s dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn t know what he s doing. He knows exactly what he s doing. Barack Obama is undertaking an effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world. Christie responded by accusing Rubio of memorizing a 25-second speech that his advisers gave him, and Rubio only helped Christie by repeating it again and again. Let s dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn t know what he s doing,  Rubio said later on.  He knows exactly what he s doing. He is trying to change this country. And again Here s the bottom line. This notion that Barack Obama doesn t know what he s doing is just not true. He knows exactly what he s doing. Here s the video via YouTube:In the end, Rubio looked a like a robot who was pre-programmed with key phrases prior to the debate but went haywire upon being challenged.This was not a good performance by Rubio, especially since he had been rising in the New Hampshire polls. But after the beating he took from Christie on Saturday night, Rubio can probably kiss his presidential aspirations goodbye.Featured Image: NBC Latino",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"If there s someone who has always stood up for the rights of women, it s Hillary Clinton. In fact, it s been pretty much her life s work. So, when a robotic, mansplaining candidate like Republican Sen. Marco Rubio decided he would throw jabs at Clinton and her stance on abortion rights, as well as abortion rights in general, she did not hold back her opinion of the Florida Senator.On ABC s  This Week  she said: It s really quite sad to see what Senator Rubio is becoming in this campaign. Everybody understands that he is diving as far right as he possibly can. I ve been on record for many years about where I stand on abortion, how it should be safe and legal. And I ve had the same position that I ve had for a very long time. But what s really going on here is an effort by the Republicans to keep pushing as far as they can to overturn Roe v. Wade, to defund Planned Parenthood, to make accusations and attacks that are really extreme It s just so unfortunate that politicians like Senator Rubio are trying to politicize these kinds of concerns and I don t think he should be allowed to get away with that. Rubio had stated that Clinton would support abortion  even on the due date of that unborn child  during Saturday night s GOP debate.While appearing on CBS  Face the Nation  Clinton reiterated her disgust in his comments, saying: I think it s pretty pathetic. This is something that illustrates how Senator Rubio has just been going as far as he can to try to, I guess, buttress his credentials with certain parts of the Republican constituency. I ve been on record for years about where I stand on making abortions safe and legal, the exceptions that are appropriate that should be looked into. And the very difficult choices that very few women have to confront that lead to excruciating kinds of decisions. Decisions Rubio, sans uterus, will never have to face.It s disgusting that women and their reproductive rights are politicized each and every election cycle, because it s pretty much they only social issue the GOP has left to get people to the polls, especially now that marriage equality is law of the land.What a woman does with her body is her decision, and her decision alone. No ifs, ands or buts about it. And unless these Republican men are cool with restrictions for their bodies as well, they better STFU.Hillary Clinton calls Rubio's comments on her abortion stance ""pathetic"" & an attempt to ""buttress his credentials"" https://t.co/u7wY0TcpCn  Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) February 7, 2016Video/Featured image: CBS News",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"White House press secretary Sean Spicer has been known for losing his sh*t, just like his boss Donald Trump   and in an off-camera news briefing on Monday, Spicer had a Trump-sized meltdown as he tried to defend the disgraceful POTUS from his self-created wiretapping debacle.PBS News Hour caught Spicer railing against the media on a live audio stream, capturing Spicer taking a particularly hostile and defensive attitude with reporters as they asked questions about Trump s unverified claims that former President Barack Obama had somehow tapped his phones at the Trump Tower.At the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Trump had blasted the media for using anonymous sources (even though he often does), and even suggested that the media  shouldn t be allowed  to cite anonymous sources. Reporters asked Spicer about Trump s anti-media comments at the CPAC, but this quickly launched into a discussion about Trump s recent accusations against Obama, as well as inquiries about what evidence Trump had to back this up. Spicer responded: People start taking things as fact because a series of off-the-record and anonymous sources   We have started to become a series of believing all these stories, and yet, I ve addressed this in the past, there s nothing there to substantiate. At some point, I would ask people to take on-the-record sources and quotes as important as the countless numbers of anonymous, off-the records. As things heated up, one reporter asked for the source that Trump had gotten his information from regarding the wiretapping. The reporter asked: So, explain this to me then. You re talking about not using anonymous sources   what is, then, the sourcing of the president s tweet on Saturday? Does he believe it s a FISA warrant? That s when poor Spicey lost it. As more reporters tried to join the conversation, the WH press secretary snapped and said: There s no cameras. You can slow it down. And of course, just like the hypocrite he is, Spicer couldn t provide a non-anonymous source. He simply said that reports are out there  from  individuals and sources. Understandably, the reporters wanted more of an answer so they continues to press Spicer. This caused him to fire back again as he said: You re not on camera. You don t need to jump in.

"Why would the Vatican invite an aggressive leftist speaker to the rollout of the Pope s Papal document on phony  global climate change?  As a Catholic, the news about the Pope s support of these horrible leftists and their radical agenda is heartbreaking. Pray for our nation One of the speakers slated for the Vatican rollout of the long-awaited Papal document on climate change once said the earth is overpopulated by at least 6 billion people.The teaching document, called an encyclical, is scheduled for release on June 18 at Vatican City. Perhaps with the exception of the 1968 encyclical on contraception, no Vatican document has been greeted with such anticipation.The political left is hoping for a document that ties belief in global warming to a religious obligation. Climate skeptics have already started criticizing the document.The choice of Professor John Schnellnhuber, founding director of the Postdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, as one of three presenters may be giving the left added hope and giving giving skeptics severe heartburn. He has been described as one of the more aggressive scientists on the question of man-made global warming.In a talk given to what s described as the  failed  2009 Copenhagen climate conference, reported in the New York Times, Schnellnhuber, who has advised German President Angela Merkel and is a visiting professor at Oxford, said of global warming:  In a very cynical way, it s a triumph for science because at last we have stabilized something  - namely the estimates for the carrying capacity of the planet, namely below 1 billion people. Schnellnhuber is also author of what s called the  two-degree target  that says governments must not allow the temperature to rise more than 2 degrees higher than at the start of the industrial revolution. Any higher, the theory holds, and much life on earth would either perish or be gravely harmed.To deal with climate issues, he has also called for an  Earth Constitution that would transcend the UN Charter  along with the creation of a  Global Council elected by all the people on Earth  and a  Planetary Court..a transnational legal body open to appeals from everybody, especially with respect to violations of the Earth Constitution.

"For some reason, Donald Trump decided to speak to a group of women at a women s empowerment event on Wednesday, on one of the final days of Women s History Month. It didn t go well.First he bragged about the number of women in his cabinet. There are six women. Out of 24. That s 25 percent. Less than half of what would be representative of the nation as a whole. It s also the whitest and most male cabinet since Ronald Reagan.It got worse. Trump went on to name women, famous women, although there s no indication that Trump knew why many of them were famous. The first part wasn t soooooo bad: Since the very beginning, women have driven, and I mean, each generation of Americans, towards a more free and more prosperous future,  Trump said.  These patriots are women like the legendary Abigail Adams, right? Who, during the founding, urged her husband to remember the rights of women. She was very much a pioneer in that way. We ve been blessed with courageous heroes like Harriet Tubman who escaped slavery. And went on to deliver hundreds of others to freedom, first in the underground railroad and then as a spy for the union army. She was very, very courageous, believe me.

Their salaries totaled $486,700.The details are contained in an annual report the White House sends to Congress showing the names, positions and salaries of all its personnel.

As with all things that she does, she is being very deliberate in her hiring, focusing on quality over quantity,  communications director Stephanie Grisham said in an email.  It is important to her that the team is a good fit for what she wants to accomplish as first lady, and that everyone works well together.

And now the picture is circulating on social media.In the image, a North Korean soldier can be seen on the right-hand corner of the picture peering in through a window and photographing Tillerson and a US Army general, Business Insider reports.The photo was taken inside the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which was created after the Korean War on what is now the most heavily armed border in the world, and obviously the most spied upon.NBC reporter Brad Jaffy tweeted out a version of the photo, which he zoomed in on, calling it  Rear Window. Rear Window: North Korean soldier takes a photo of Rex Tillerson at the DMZ pic.twitter.com/EHCIR3Fjo6  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 17, 2017The original photo can be seen here.Tillerson announced on Friday at a news conference in Seoul that military action against North Korea is  an option  if the threat from its nuclear weapons program rises to a level  that we believe requires action. Tillerson told reporters that  all of the options are on the table. According to the Korea Herald, Tillerson cut his recent visit short with South Korean officials due to  fatigue. The newspaper reported that Tillerson did not have lunch or dinner with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn during his visit there.Tillerson spent several hours meeting with Japanese officials, which included dinner meetings, the paper noted, according to The Hill.The secretary of State reportedly did hold talks with both South Korean officials regarding the threat posed by North Korea s nuclear program.And that must have been before  fatigue  set in. On Twitter, Trump said that North Korea was  behaving very badly. South Korea s Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye in March over a corruption scandal. In contrast, the U.S. has failed to address its newly minted president s growing list of scandals. Tillerson, too, has his own scandal to deal with.As for the North Korean soldier spying on Tillerson, perhaps if he wore spy glasses and a fake mustache no one would have noticed.

"On April 11th, before he spoke at his rally in Albany, New York, Bernie Sanders met with local Black Lives Matter activists.  The local police department has a long history of corruption and abuse. In April 2015, Albany Police Officers killed unarmed 39-year-old Dontay Ivy. While he was walking home from an ATM they tasered him and beat him to death with police batons. Mr. Ivy was mentally ill. In the video, his aunt takes Bernie Sanders through what happened. No officers were charged in the death and a grand jury found no criminal wrongdoing because of a lack of witnesses. Allegedly the dash cams in the patrol cars were turned off. I worried about my brother all the time. I thought outside elements would hurt him. But the people who were supposed to protect him, they re the ones who hurt him,  Dontay Ivy s sister, Johnson, told Senator Sanders in tears.Bernie Sanders has lead the call for police reform in the Democratic Primaries. He was the only candidate who called for a Department of Justice investigation in December 2015 after it was announced there would be no indictment of the police officers involved. He was the only candidate who called for Mayor Rahm Emanuel to resign over his administration s overt cover up of unarmed teenager LaQuan MacDonald s death. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate who has proposed that the Department of Justice investigates every death caused by police involvement or in police custody so police departments can t cover up the incidents or protect their own from being held accountable for their actions. I got the racial profiling issues, I got it. And I got the need for police reform. What we should be doing is training police officers to deal with issues, although this doesn t seem to be a terribly difficult issue, this is not like somebody with a weapon or anything. It s a guy walking down the street, right? Going home. It s not exactly a major crime,  Bernie Sanders told the group backstage. What we don t have yet is a culture in this country that says to the police departments that lethal force, in this case using a Taser several times is a last resort, not a first resort, right? Clearly, in this particular case, it can be dealt with in a hundred different ways. The full video below, released by the Albany chapter of Black Lives Matter, shows the group s entire discussion backstage at the Washington Avenue Armory in Albany, New York. https://www.facebook.com/BLMUpstateNY/videos/1084906804903398/Featured image via Flickr",human fake,1,ISOT Fake News Dataset,0
"Last year, Trump claimed he was succeeding at saving manufacturing jobs by making individual deals with individual companies, like Carrier in Indiana. At the time, people pointed out that he was boasting about the Carrier deal while totally ignoring another Indiana company, Rexnord, that was likewise shipping its jobs to Mexico.And now, Rexnord has done so. NBC News did a report on the plant s closure, which Trump must have watched because he felt the need to lay the blame for this on Obama shortly after it aired:Rexnord of Indiana made a deal during the Obama Administration to move to Mexico. Fired their employees. Tax product big that s sold in U.S.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2017The funny thing is that if he hadn t been bragging about how great he was at saving manufacturing jobs the instant he won the election, and threatening companies who were trying to outsource, he might actually have a case to make. But he promised to save these kinds of jobs and implied that he would do it company by company if he had to.All he did with Rexnord was tweet at them, which did nothing to sway their decision. And their employees feel as though Trump failed them. As one employee said: In the long run, he s done forgot about us  cause he s moved on to bigger and better things. Perhaps this little plant was just too little for Trump to bother with. The move will save Rexnord tens of millions of dollars, because they can pay Mexican workers $3 per hour vs. the $25 per hour they were paying their American workers. Regardless, this is what Trump said back in December, shortly after claiming victory with both Ford and Carrier:Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016To our knowledge, Trump never even tried to save these jobs despite calling this company out and threatening them with huge tariffs should they actually do this.

This is what the New York Times had to say about Sessions  racist past when Trump announced him as his attorney general pick.While serving as a United States prosecutor in Alabama, Mr. Sessions was nominated in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan for a federal judgeship. But his nomination was rejected by the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee because of racially charged comments and actions. At that time, he was one of two judicial nominees whose selections were halted by the panel in nearly 50 years.In testimony before the committee, former colleagues said that Mr. Sessions had referred to the N.A.A.C.P., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and other civil rights groups as  un-American  and  Communist-inspired.  An African-American federal prosecutor then, Thomas H. Figures, said Mr. Sessions had referred to him as  boy  and testified that Mr. Sessions said the Ku Klux Klan was fine  until I found out they smoked pot.  Mr. Sessions dismissed that remark as a joke.Mr. Sessions was also accused of speaking disparagingly of the Voting Rights Act and the stringent oversight it placed on Southern states.Gee, I wonder why the NAACP doesn t think we should appoint this guy as the nation s attorney general? Maybe because he could set civil rights back decades?According to Alabama NAACP President Benard Simelton, he and the 15-20 other protesters will stay put until  Sessions meets our demands or the arrest   whichever he chooses.

"In a shocking turn of events, the once-thriving city of San Francisco has been plunged into chaos as a mysterious, airborne illness has swept through its streets, leaving residents in a state of panic. Dubbed the ""San Francisco Sneeze,"" the illness, which appears to be highly contagious, has been traced back to a single source: a local tech startup, GenTech Labs. The company, which specializes in genetic engineering, has been accused of conducting unauthorized experiments on the city's population. GenTech Labs, which has previously faced criticism for its lack of transparency and disregard for ethical guidelines, denies any wrongdoing. However, the city's health department has confirmed that the illness is caused by a genetically modified virus, and that the company's lab was the only facility in the city with the necessary equipment to produce such a virus. The San Francisco Mayor's office has declared a state of emergency, and the city's hospitals are struggling to keep up with the influx of patients. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been called in to assist, but so far, there is no known cure for the San Francisco Sneeze. As the city grapples with this unprecedented crisis, many are calling for stricter regulations on genetic engineering, and for GenTech Labs to be held accountable for its actions. The future of San Francisco, and potentially the entire nation, hangs in the balance. Will the city be able to recover from this devastating blow, or will it be forever changed by the San Francisco Sneeze? Only time will tell.",llm fake,2,Generated,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3
"In a shocking turn of events, the infamous Silicon Valley tech giant, Google, has been accused of secretly harvesting personal data from millions of its users, including sensitive information such as medical records, financial transactions, and private conversations. The allegations, which surfaced this week, have sent ripples through the tech industry and beyond, with privacy advocates calling for immediate action and a full investigation into the matter. ""This is a blatant violation of trust and a serious invasion of privacy,"" said John Doe, a leading privacy expert at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ""Google has been given access to some of the most intimate details of people's lives, and it's unacceptable that they would use this information for their own gain.""

However, the company has yet to provide any concrete evidence to back up its claims, leaving many skeptical of its intentions. As the investigation continues, privacy advocates are urging users to delete their Google accounts and switch to more secure alternatives. ""The time for complacency is over,"" said Doe. ""We cannot afford to trust companies like Google with our personal information any longer.""

"In a shocking turn of events, the world's largest tech conglomerate, Google, has announced plans to launch a revolutionary new AI system capable of predicting human emotions. Dubbed ""EmoSense,"" the AI system will reportedly analyze facial expressions, tone of voice, and even body language to determine a person's emotional state in real-time. While the potential applications of such technology are vast, privacy advocates are raising concerns over the implications of a system that can read human emotions without consent. Critics argue that EmoSense could be used for nefarious purposes, such as manipulating political campaigns or even blackmailing individuals. Google, however, maintains that EmoSense is designed with the best intentions, aiming to improve mental health services and support for those suffering from emotional distress. The company has also emphasized that EmoSense will be subject to rigorous testing and oversight to ensure it is used ethically and responsibly. As the world awaits the launch of EmoSense, many are left questioning the boundaries of artificial intelligence and the potential impact on human privacy and autonomy. With the rapid advancement of technology, it seems that the age of emotional transparency may be upon us, and the implications are far from clear.",llm fake,2,Generated,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3
